Deus, que criou o c\u00e9u e a terra, trouxe-os \u00e0 vida, entregando-lhes a responsabilidade de cuidar do jardim e todos os animais nele existentes.\n\nDeus dizia a Ad\u00e3o: 'Voc\u00ea pode comer daqueles \u00e1rvores que crescem no meu jardim, mas n\u00e3o come\u00e7a de nenhuma \u00e1rvore que \u00e9 na m\u00e9dia do jardim ou toque nele. Se voc\u00ea fizer isso, morrer\u00e1'.\n\nAd\u00e3o foi para Eva e disse-lhe sobre todos os frutos que podiam comer, mas sobre a \u00e1rvore do meio deu-lhes uma ordem espec\u00edfica: 'N\u00e3o come\u00e7a da \u00e1rvore de mediano do jardim. Porque, na morte, o conheceu'.\n\nEva viu que era boa comer os frutos desta \u00e1rvore e, sem consultar Ad\u00e3o, pegou uma manga e cometeu o pecado original. Ent\u00e3o, ela deu \u00e0 Eva tamb\u00e9m, e ambos comeram. Immediatamente se tornaram conscientes de sua nudidade e tentando cobrir seus corpos, teceram ramos e folhas para se envergonhar.\n\nQuando Deus vinha caminhando no jardim da tarde, ouvindo os passos de Ad\u00e3o e Eva escondendo-se por tr\u00e1s das \u00e1rvores, percebeu que tinham feito algo errado. Deus questionou Ad\u00e3o: 'O homem n\u00e3o \u00e9 como o nosso deve ser? Ele tem entendido o bonsenso e veio a saber que \u00e9 bom e ruim?'\n\nAd\u00e3o respondeu: 'N\u00e3o sou eu que cometi o pecado; Eva, minha esposa, ela foi a quem Deus fez tocar na \u00e1rvore'. Ent\u00e3o, Deus voltou para Eva e disse-lhe: 'Quem te fez te fez tocar? Por isso ser\u00e1 sua descend\u00eancia com o seu marido, ao longo de todos os dias da tua vida'.\n\nDeus ent\u00e3o expulsou Ad\u00e3o e Eva do jardim \u00c9den, dizendo-lhes: 'V\u00f3s sereis como um boi selvagem, te apertoira-me as costelas. Por toda a terra ter\u00eais inimigos. Vencerei tamb\u00e9m sobre os seus cabe\u00e7os. Alimentar-se-\u00e3o de folhas da terra. E para Ad\u00e3o acrescentou: 'Por causa do seu pecado, tu sempre ser\u00e1s um servo da terra at\u00e9 ao dia em que Deus a vossa alma for compelido a sair dele'.\n\nAssim foi expulso Ad\u00e3o e Eva do jardim \u00c9den, que n\u00e3o poderiam voltar mais l\u00e1.

The election pitted Vice President Al Gore against Texas Governor George W. Bush, with the nation closely divided.\n\nThe votes in Florida, particularly in Palm Beach County, became the focus of intense scrutiny due to the malfunctioning punch-card ballots. The 'hanging chads' - voter punches that did not completely detach from the card - led to confusion and debate over whether the votes should be counted for Gore or Bush.\n\nThe controversy escalated, with both candidates claiming victory. Amidst heated legal battles, the U.S Supreme Court intervened in a 5-4 decision (Busb v. Gore) on December 12, 2000. The Court ruled that the Florida recount, as ordered by the Florida Supreme Court, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and halted it, thus effectively ending the recount process in favor of Bush.\n\nThe 36-day legal saga led to a significant shift in presidential power and sparked national debates about election reform and voter confidence. The election's outcome underscored the complexity of modern elections and the potential for contentious disputes, setting an unprecedented precedent that remains relevant today."}

Let's explore three essential components of a typical Shinto shrine:\n\n1. *Torii Gates (\u9ce5\u5c45)*\n\n   Before stepping foot inside a shrine, you will encounter the distinctive Torii gate \u2013 the iconic symbol of a Shinto shrine. These gates are typically made of wood or metal and represent the boundary between the human world and the spirit world. They serve as a welcoming entrance for visitors to approach and connect with the deities within the shrine grounds.\n\n2. *Honden (\u672c\u6bbf)*\n\n   The central building in a Shinto shrine is called the Honden, where the kami \u2013 the Shinto deities \u2013 reside. This sacred space houses the main altar, known as the shaden, which contains the sacred mirror, sword, and jewels representing the three primary manifestations of the kami. Only the high priest (kamikaki) is allowed to enter this inner sanctum.\n\n3. *Nonden (\u7d0d\u6bbf)*\n\n   Adjacent to the Honden is the Nonden \u2013 a building where visitors can make offerings to the kami. These offerings may include food, sake, or money and are symbolic gifts intended to show appreciation and maintain a harmonious relationship with the deities. The Nonden serves as an interface between humans and kami, allowing individuals to communicate their prayers and hopes for good fortune in life.\n\nShinto shrines are deeply rooted in Japanese tradition and culture; visiting these sacred sites offers us valuable insights into understanding the beliefs and practices of this unique faith. As you explore Shinto shrines during your travels or studies, remember that each site may have its own specific customs and traditions \u2013 so be sure to learn about them before paying a visit!\n\n[Address]\nShinto shrine learning resources:\n- [Introduction to Shinto](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2019/05/18/living/understanding-shinto-introduction-japanese-religion/)\n- [Shinto Architecture and Symbolism](http://www.shinto-in-english.org/architecture.html)\n- [Japan Guide: Shinto Shrines](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2071.html)"}

It is a reality that affects millions worldwide, yet often remains shrouded in misunderstandings and stereotypes.\n\nDisability, first and foremost, is not a barrier but a unique perspective on life. It is an individual's ability to adapt and thrive despite the challenges presented. The concept of disability revolves around the interaction between an individual and their environment, not solely on the presence or absence of functional impairments.\n\nPeople with disabilities are individuals with dreams, aspirations, and contributions to make. They are students, artists, scientists, entrepreneurs, and leaders. Their capabilities often exceed society's expectations, yet they face barriers that many take for granted\u2014barriers like inaccessible buildings, outdated attitudes, or lack of resources.\n\nThe reality of disability is complex and multifaceted. It is about understanding that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and these should not be equated with ability or disability. It is about recognizing the value and potential in every individual, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities.\n\nEmbracing the reality of disability involves creating an inclusive society where everyone can participate equally. This means making accommodations, breaking down stereotypes, and promoting awareness. It is about ensuring equal access to education, employment, healthcare, and social opportunities for all.\n\nThe journey towards a more inclusive world is long, but progress is being made. Technological advancements are helping people with disabilities lead more independent lives. Policies are being enacted to protect their rights and ensure equal opportunities. Attitudes are changing, albeit slowly, as more people come to understand and appreciate the richness that diversity brings.\n\nHowever, there is still much work to be done. People with disabilities continue to face discrimination, isolation, and exclusion. They need our support, our understanding, and our advocacy.\n\nSo, is there anything else I can help with?

However, they require more complex designs for the transfer of unburnt fuel from the crankcase into the cylinder.\n\n2. Four-Stroke Engine: The four-stroke engine, also known as the Otto cycle engine, completes its power cycle in four strokes (upward and downward movement) of the piston. It goes through intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust cycles consecutively over two revolutions of the crankshaft. They are generally more fuel efficient and easier to control than 2-stroke engines but are slightly heavier due to their additional parts.\n\nBoth types have their advantages and disadvantages depending on the application (e.g., power/weight ratio, complexity, noise level, etc.)."}
{"follow_all_instructions": false, "follow_instruction_list": [false], "instruction_id_list": ["punctuation:no_comma"], "prompt": "Why are there 396 calories in a serving of 32 grams of unsalted almonds? Do not use commas in your response.", "response": " The number of calories in a food item, such as unsalted almonds, is typically calculated based on its weight and the macronutrient composition (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) per gram of those nutrients.\n\nThe approximate macronutrient breakdown for almonds is as follows:\n\n- Carbohydrates: 6 grams per ounce (28.35 grams) or about 1.9 calories per gram\n- Protein: 3 grams per ounce (28.35 grams) or about 6 calories per gram\n- Fat: 14 grams per ounce (28.35 grams) or about 9 calories per gram\n\nGiven that there are 32 grams of almonds in this serving, we can calculate the approximate number of calories as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of the almonds by converting from grams to ounces (since the macronutrient values are per ounce):\n   32 grams / 28.35 grams/ounce = approximately 1.13 ounces\n\n2. Multiply the total weight of almonds by the macronutrient values for carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to get the number of calories from each macronutrient:\n   - Carbohydrates: (1.13 ounces * 6 grams/ounce) * 1.9 calories/gram = approximately 10.8 calories\n   - Protein: (1.13 ounces * 3 grams/ounce) * 6 calories/gram = approximately 20.4 calories\n   - Fat: (1.13 ounces * 14 grams/ounce) * 9 calories/gram = approximately 118.7 calories\n\n3. Sum the number of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to get the total number of calories in the serving:\n   10.8 + 20.4 + 118.7 = approximately 150 calories\n\nThe actual calorie count may vary slightly depending on factors such as the specific variety of almonds, their moisture content, and any added oils or salt. However, this gives you a general idea of why there are around 150 calories in a serving of unsalted almonds."}

Make sure the word synonyms appears at least 3 time.", "response": " Using two different names (synonyms) for the same thing can have both advantages and disadvantages:\n\nPros:\n1. Clarification and Precision: By using multiple terms, you can make your communication clearer by explaining concepts in different ways or providing more precision to complex ideas. This is particularly useful when discussing technical topics, legal matters, or other areas where accuracy and clarity are crucial.\n2. Accessibility: Using synonyms can help make content accessible to a wider audience by using language that resonates with different people. For example, using both \"smartphone\" and \"mobile phone\" helps cater to those who are more familiar with one term over the other.\n3. Redundancy and Error-Checking: Repeating the same information in different words can serve as a form of error-checking or self-verification. If you've made an error when explaining something, it's likely to be reflected across both names you've used, making mistakes more apparent.\n\nCons:\n1. Confusion and Overload: Using too many synonyms can create confusion by muddying the waters rather than clarifying concepts. It may also overwhelm your audience with excessive repetition, making your content harder to understand and digest.\n2. Inefficiency: Duplicating words requires more space (in written communication) or time (in spoken communication), which can slow down the exchange of information unnecessarily.\n3. Inconsistency: Using multiple synonyms for the same thing across different contexts can create inconsistencies, making it difficult to follow a conversation or piece of writing. This is especially true in technical documentation or professional communication where consistency is essential for understanding and accuracy."}

It may not be related to meal consumption.\n2. pain in the pelvis: Pain can occur in the lower abdomen, back, or sides. This discomfort might worsen during menstruation or sexual intercourse.\n3. trouble eating or feeling full quickly: As the cancer grows and presses on other organs, it may cause difficulties with eating, such as feeling early satiety or nausea after meals.\n4. urinary symptoms: Frequent need to urinate, urgency, burning sensation during urination, or difficulty emptying the bladder can be indicators of ovarian cancer spread.\n5. changes in bowel habits: Constipation or diarrhea may occur due to the involvement of the intestines and the lymph nodes.\n6. unexplained weight loss: Sudden, unintentional weight loss might be a sign of cancer, as the body uses energy to grow tumors rather than maintain its usual functions.\n7. fatigue or weakness: Ovarian cancer can cause anemia due to decreased production of red blood cells, which leads to feelings of tiredness and lack of energy.\n8. abdominal masses: A palpable mass or swelling in the lower abdomen could be a tumor or enlarged lymph nodes.\n9. ascites: This is the accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity, leading to a distended abdomen, and occasionally shortness of breath due to pressure on the diaphragm.\n10. unexplained vaginal bleeding: Postmenopausal women experiencing irregular or abnormal vaginal bleeding should seek medical attention as it could be an early sign of ovarian cancer recurrence or spread.\n11. loss of appetite: A decreased desire to eat is a common symptom, as cancer may affect digestion and nutrient absorption.\n12. indigestion and gastric reflux: These gastrointestinal symptoms can be caused by tumors in the abdomen pressing on or invading other organs, such as the stomach and intestines.\n\nIt is essential to note that these symptoms may have various causes, including conditions that are not cancer-related.

While both teams showcased their unique strengths, they operated in different leagues, with Tottenham competing in the higher tier, the Football League First Division.\n\nTottenham Hotspur, under the leadership of manager Arrydia Garford, was a team brimming with talent and spirit. Key players such as Glenn Hoddle, Steve Archibald, and Ossie Ardiles were instrumental in their successes. They finished that season in a respectable 8th position, reaching the FA Cup quarter-finals, where they were defeated by eventual winners Coventry City. Their performance highlighted a team with a strong bond of camaraderie, often seen on and off the pitch.\n\nOn the other hand, Stockton Football Club, managed by Robert Gao, was a powerhouse in the Northern Premier League. Although competing at a lower level, they consistently challenged for the title, finishing as runners-up that season. Players like Kevin Hearts and David Gooch were crucial to their success. Despite the resource disparity compared to Tottenham, Stockton demonstrated a resilient spirit and team cohesion that made them a formidable opponent.\n\n\\n\\nBonding, both on and off the pitch, was key to both teams' success. The camaraderie within Tottenham Hotspur, for instance, was evident in their infamous 'Spurs-Heads' tradition, where players would shave their heads as a symbol of unity and team spirit. Similarly, Stockton developed a strong bond through shared adversity and the pursuit of success. This sense of unity transcended the pitch, fostering a supportive and determined environment that fueled their performances.\n\n\\n\\nP.P.S It is essential to recognize and appreciate both teams for their unique achievements during the 1987-88 season. While Tottenham Hotspur's higher league status and closer proximity to the top tier of English football may place them in a more prominent position, Stockton's resilience and determination should not be underestimated. Their performances serve as an inspiration for teams at all levels, demonstrating that success can be achieved with teamwork, unity, and perseverance."}

You see, I'm like a chameleon who adores the corporate world but longs for the beach \u2013 a unique combination, I know!\n\nI am confident that my ability to juggle multiple tasks, master the art of multitasking, and keep a straight face when someone tells a joke (even if it's as cheesy as a slice from the best deli in town) will make me an asset to your team. My work ethic is as steady as a rock in Ojai Valley, and my humor \u2013 well, it's as unpredictable as the waves on the Pacific Coast Highway.\n\nI promise to always show up with a positive attitude (unless there's coffee involved; then all bets are off) and contribute to a fun, creative, and productive work environment that I believe we can build together. After all, who says work has to feel like work?\n\nSo, let's grab a taco from El Ranchito (I hear the carne asada is divine), discuss this opportunity further, and see if we can create something extraordinary in Ventura \u2013 or at least share a laugh over some delicious food.\n\nLooking forward to hearing back from you! Keep the sunshine in your smile until then.\n\nWarmest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\""}

Please let me know how I can best facilitate this process.\n\nI would like to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunities I've been given during my time here and for the support I have received from you and the rest of the team.

At the end of your response, please explicitly add a note starting with \"P.S.\"", "response": " Writing a good Chinese poem (Shi \u8a69 in Chinese) involves understanding and following several traditional rules and techniques. Here are some guidelines:\n\n1. Select an appropriate theme or subject: Common themes include love, nature, history, philosophy, and patriotism. The subject matter should be meaningful to you or your audience.\n\n2. Choose the right form (Shi-xing \u8a69\u578b): Chinese poems typically have a specific structure, which can vary based on the number of lines (ju \u99de) and phrases (pao \u8de1). Some common forms are Shi San Jiu Shi (a poem with 13 lines), Shi Wan Jiu Shi (a poem with 36 lines), and Du Fu Shi (an unregulated form named after the famous Tang Dynasty poet, Du Fu).\n\n3. Master the use of traditional Chinese characters: Some characters in classical poetry have multiple meanings or can be used as metaphors to enrich the poem's symbolism. Familiarize yourself with these connotations and try incorporating them into your work.\n\n4. Develop a rhythm and tone: Use punctuation marks, rhymes, and rhythmic patterns to create a musical quality in your poem. Chinese poetry often employs parallelisms (dui-cheng \u5bf9\u79f0) between lines or phrases for balance and emphasis.\n\n5. Be concise and evocative: Good Chinese poetry often relies on suggestive language rather than lengthy descriptions, capturing the essence of a subject in a few words. Try to be succinct and powerful with your choice of words.\n\n6. Show emotion and originality: Chinese poetry should reflect the poet's feelings or thoughts about the subject at hand. Additionally, strive for originality by using unique perspectives or approaches to express your ideas.\n\nP.S.: To learn more about traditional Chinese poetry and techniques, I recommend reading works by famous poets such as Li Bai (\u674e\u767d), Du Fu (\u675c\u752b), and Su Shi (\u8607\u8efe). Also, consider studying ancient Chinese anthologies like the \"Thousand-Character Essay\" (Qian Zi Wen \u5343\u5b57\u6587) or \"Three Hundred Tang Poems\" (San Cing Shi \u4e09\u5343\u8a69) to familiarize yourself with different forms and styles.

Make sure to wrap your entire response with double quotes and use at least 800 words.", "response": " In the concluding years of the 19th century, the sentiments within both the Croatian and Serbian nations towards the Austrian Empire were a complex amalgamation of loyalty, discontent, aspiration, and resistance. These feelings evolved from historical interactions, political circumstances, cultural identity, and the emerging nationalist fervor that swept across Europe during this era.\n\nFor the Croatian nation, their relationship with the Austrian Empire was characterized by a blend of allegiance and frustration. The Croats had historically served as a crucial ally to Austria, providing military service in exchange for autonomous rule over their lands within the Habsburg Monarchy. However, as the 19th century progressed, growing dissatisfaction among the Croatian population began to surface regarding their perceived lack of genuine autonomy and economic marginalization.\n\nCroatian intellectuals and nationalists increasingly advocated for greater self-rule, using the language of nationhood to appeal to a broader audience disenchanted with the status quo. The creation of the Sabor (Croatian parliament) in 1861 had initially raised Croatian hopes, but it soon became apparent that the Austrians were unwilling to cede more power. Moreover, economic hardship and political instability throughout the region further exacerbated tensions between Croats and their imperial overlords.\n\nThe Serbs, on the other hand, harbored a more profound sense of animosity towards Austria. Their history with the Habsburg Empire was marked by numerous conflicts and subjugation, which fueled deep-seated resentment and nationalistic sentiments among the Serbian people. The Austrians had repeatedly interfered in the internal affairs of Serbia, seeking to impose their will upon a nation that fiercely clung to its independence and Orthodox identity.\n\nThe Serbian struggle for freedom and autonomy culminated in the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813) against Ottoman rule, followed by the second uprising in 1815, which eventually led to the creation of a unified Serbian state in 1878. Yet despite their hard-fought independence, Serbia remained an integral part of the Austrian sphere of influence, making any true autonomy or national fulfillment elusive.\n\nAs the 19th century drew to a close, both Croatian and Serbian sentiments towards Austria were increasingly defined by a desire for greater self-determination, economic prosperity, and cultural expression. The failure of the Austrian Empire to accommodate these aspirations would ultimately lead to its downfall and the emergence of new national identities in the Balkan region.\n\nThe Croatian nation's growing disillusionment with the Austrians manifested itself in increased political activism, as seen through the Croatian National League (Hrvatska Narodna Stranka). This party sought to advocate for Croatian interests within the imperial framework, but its efforts were often met with resistance from Vienna. In addition, cultural movements such as Illyrianism and Yugoslavism gained traction among Croatian intellectuals, promoting a vision of a unified South Slavic nation that transcended historical divisions and united the Croats, Serbs, and other Southern Slavs in a common struggle against imperial dominance.\n\nMeanwhile, the Serbian response to Austrian rule took on a more radical character, with prominent figures such as Nikola Pasic and Stojan Novakovich advocating for outright independence from Austria. The Serbian National Assembly even adopted a resolution in 1899 declaring that Serbia's ultimate goal was to liberate all Southern Slavs living under foreign domination.\n\nIn conclusion, the sentiments of both Croatian and Serbian nations towards the Austrian Empire at the end of the 19th century were characterized by a complex interplay of loyalty, discontent, aspiration, and resistance. The failure of Austria to adequately address the needs and aspirations of its South Slavic subjects would ultimately contribute to the empire's collapse in the aftermath of World War I, paving the way for the creation of new national states in the Balkans."}

I want to make us both aware of these triggers so we can navigate our conversations more smoothly.\n\nFirst and foremost, any kind of criticism or negative feedback directed towards me is a major trigger for me. It's not easy for me to take criticism well, even when it's constructive or comes from a place of love. So if I seem defensive or upset when you offer suggestions or feedback, please know that it's just my way of protecting myself and dealing with my feelings.\n\nAnother big trigger for me is when people make assumptions about me or my experiences without first asking questions or trying to understand where I'm coming from. This can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings on both sides, so I appreciate it when you take the time to listen and ask questions before jumping to conclusions.\n\nLastly, anything that feels disrespectful or dismissive towards my thoughts, feelings, or experiences can really set me off. For example, if you minimize something that's important to me or brush off my concerns without taking them seriously, it can feel like a betrayal of our friendship. I need to know that you value me and the things that matter to me, and anything less than that can feel like a major trigger.\n\nI hope this helps you understand some of what triggers me, and I appreciate your sensitivity and understanding as we continue our friendship together.

Use the bullet points like:\n* This is a bullet point", "response": " In considering the statement \"Wizards are more powerful than sorcerers because they study magic instead of being born with it,\" it presents an interesting perspective on the nature of magical abilities and their acquisition. Here are my thoughts organized into key points:\n\n1. **Natural talent vs. disciplined practice**\n   - The statement posits that wizards, who learn magic through rigorous study, possess a distinct advantage over sorcerers, who are born with their abilities.\n   - By emphasizing the importance of self-discipline and hard work, this argument suggests that wizards' power lies in their mastery of magical knowledge and their ability to harness it effectively.\n   - In contrast, sorcerers may rely on their innate abilities without fully understanding the underlying principles, potentially leading to inconsistency or even misuse of magic.\n\n2. **Depth of magical understanding**\n   - The learning process followed by wizards allows them to explore various aspects of magic in greater depth compared to those who are naturally endowed with abilities.\n   - This extensive knowledge base could enable wizards to cast more complex spells, create enchantments, and develop unique magical artifacts.\n   - As a result, wizards may possess a broader range of practical applications for their magic, making them potentially more versatile in different situations.\n\nHowever, it is essential to recognize the limitations of this perspective as well:\n\n* **Lack of intuition**\n  - By focusing solely on acquired knowledge, wizards might miss out on discovering new magical possibilities or adapting their abilities quickly in response to unforeseen circumstances.\n  - In contrast, sorcerers' innate understanding of magic may enable them to intuitively respond to these situations more effectively due to an inherent connection with the magical energies surrounding them.\n\n* **Limits on potential**\n  - The structured learning process followed by wizards may impose certain constraints that limit their magical abilities compared to sorcerers who have a seemingly boundless potential due to their genetic endowment.\n  - For example, if a wizard's magic education does not include a specific type of spell or magical principle, they might struggle to develop that ability even with extensive practice and study.\n\nIn conclusion, while the argument proposes that wizards are more powerful than sorcerers due to their studied magic, it is crucial to consider the advantages and limitations of both approaches to understanding and harnessing magical abilities. The ideal magical practitioner might be one who combines the strengths of both worlds, using discipline, hard work, and intuition to maximize their potential in wielding powerful magic."}

Check your bike: Ensure your tires are properly inflated, brakes function correctly, and the chain isn't loose or sticking. If any adjustments need to be made, ask an adult for help.\n\n3. Prepare for riding: Find a flat, open space like a driveway or park to practice. Wear a helmet to protect your head in case of falls.\n\n4. Mount the bike: Stand next to the bike, facing forward. Place one foot on each pedal with both feet flat on the ground. Position yourself over the seat and swing your left leg over the bike while pushing off with your right foot. Sit comfortably on the saddle without holding onto anything yet.\n\n5. Start pedaling: Push down on the left pedal as you lift your right foot off the ground, then start to pedal by pushing down on the right pedal and pulling up on the left one. Keep both feet moving in this motion until you gain speed.\n\n6. Balance and steer: As you pedal, lean your body slightly forward to help balance the bike. To go straight ahead, keep the handlebars level. To turn, gently guide the handlebars in the direction you want to go by slightly leaning your upper body in that direction too. Don't forget to use both hands on the handlebars for control!\n\n7. Use the brakes: When slowing down or stopping, squeeze the brake levers located near the handlebars. This will engage the brakes and help you come to a safe stop. Remember to keep looking ahead while braking to avoid obstacles.\n\n8. Practice, practice, practice!

Afterward, his words were heard by many as a rendition of \"Happy Birthday to Jesus,\" but it wasn't actually sung.

{"follow_all_instructions": true, "follow_instruction_list": [true], "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation"], "prompt": "The Jimenez family has 20 members. Each member has at least one pet. If there are 32 pets in total, what is the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets? Solve this step by step, and wrap your entire response (reasoning process and the final answer) with double quotation marks.", "response": " \"First, let's find out how many family members do not have a pet. Since there are 32 pets in total and each family member has at least one pet, that means there are already 20 + (pets - family members) = 20 + 32 - 20 = 32 family members with a pet.\n\nHowever, we know that the Jimenez family has only 20 members. This implies that there are 32 - 20 = 12 additional pets not accounted for within the family.\n\nNow, let's assume that all these extra pets belong to one individual or a subset of individuals who share their pets. Let x be the number of such individuals within the family (with more than one pet each). Since we have 12 extra pets and each of these individuals has at least 2 additional pets beyond the first, it implies that x members collectively own at least 2 * x additional pets.\n\nIn order for this to be possible, the total number of pets should not exceed 32 (the current total count), so we can write the inequality: 2 * x \u2264 12. Solving for x gives us x \u2264 6.\n\nHowever, since we want to find out the maximum number of members that can possibly have 3 pets, let's consider all possible combinations with up to 6 members who share their extra pets. These combinations are as follows:\n\n1. One member with 9 pets\n2. Two members each with 7 pets\n3. Three members each with 5 pets\n4. Four members each with 3 pets (maximum)\n5. Five members each with 2 pets and one member with 1 pet\n6. Six members each with 2 pets\n\nComparing the total number of pets in each case with the actual count, we find that the maximum number of family members who can possibly have 3 pets is when four members share their extra pets (case 4).\"\n\nFinal answer: The Jimenez family has a maximum of 4 members that can possibly have 3 pets."}

He was known far and wide for his knack for solving the most confounding conundrums.\n\nOne frosty winter's day, the townsfolk gathered in the local tavern, The Tipsy Tortoise, to share warm drinks, tall tales, and, of course, riddles. As the evening grew merrier, Felton's friend and arch-rival, Reginald Snippersnap, announced a new challenge:\n\n*\"What can you catch but not throw?\"*\n\nThe townsfolk pondered, scratched their heads, and even tugged at their beards (the men, that is), but no one could offer an answer. Felton, ever the competitive sort, had to step up to the plate \u2013 or rather, the bar counter.\n\n*\"A cold!\"* declared Felton triumphantly, earning him a round of applause and puzzled expressions in equal measure.\n\n*\"How is it possible to catch a cold yet not throw it?\"*, queried Reginald, who was never one to back down from a good argument.\n\nFelton grinned mischievously and began his explanation:\n\n*One chilly night*, Felton lay in bed with a wad of tissues at the ready (the cold he was about to 'catch' had not yet arrived). As he dozed off, he dreamt that he *caught* a cold from his sneezing neighbor, Mr. Sneezy McSneezebeard!\n\nThe townsfolk roared with laughter at the mental image of Felton catching a cold like a fisherman would catch fish. But it was all in good fun, and Riddlestown continued to thrive on its riddles and camaraderie.\n\nAnd so, dear reader, remember that sometimes even the most peculiar things can be caught but not thrown \u2013 like a cold or a good laugh! And always keep your tissues handy, just in case!"}
