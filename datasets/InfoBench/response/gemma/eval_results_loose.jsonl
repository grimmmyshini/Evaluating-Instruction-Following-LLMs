In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.\nWrite a title for the above paragraph.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions to these challenges by automating tasks, extracting meaningful insights from data, and providing personalized and responsive care.\n\n**Related Work:**\n\nAI applications in healthcare have gained significant traction. Examples include:\n\n* **Predictive analytics:** Early detection of diseases and risk stratification for personalized interventions.\n* **Image analysis:** Automated disease diagnosis and staging through analysis of medical images.\n* **Chatbots and virtual assistants:** Enhanced patient engagement and symptom monitoring.\n* **Robot automation:** Improved efficiency in repetitive tasks like medication administration and patient transport.\n\n**Limitations of Prior Work:**\n\nDespite the potential of AI, existing solutions face limitations:\n\n* Lack of interpretability and bias in algorithms\n* Data quality issues and privacy concerns\n* Limited adoption and integration with existing healthcare infrastructure\n* Ethical considerations surrounding AI applications\n\n**Research Objectives:**\n\nThis research aims to:\n\n1. Develop a hybrid AI framework that addresses interpretability and bias issues in existing algorithms.\n2. Integrate the proposed framework with electronic health records (EHRs) for seamless data access and analysis.\n3. Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for seamless AI-powered healthcare delivery.\n\n**Proposed Methods:**\n\nThis research proposes a novel approach that combines:\n\n* **Explainable AI:** Development of algorithms that provide interpretable explanations of their predictions to enhance trust and accountability.\n* **Privacy-Preserving Data Analytics:** Implementation of differential privacy techniques to protect sensitive patient data during training and deployment.\n* **Blockchain Technology:** Use of blockchain technology to ensure secure data storage, access, and accountability.\n\n**Distinction from Prior Work:**\n\nOur approach overcomes limitations of existing AI solutions by:\n\n* Addressing interpretability and bias through explainable AI\n* Enhancing data privacy through differential privacy\n* Leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced security and accountability\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAI holds immense potential to transform healthcare outcomes by automating tasks, analyzing data, and providing personalized care. By addressing interpretability, privacy, and security concerns through innovative techniques, this research will contribute to the successful implementation of AI for improved healthcare."}

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.\n\nWrite a title for the above text in double angular brackets i.e. <<title>.

Throughout human experience, countless instances exist where seemingly ordinary moments have become pivotal points, shaping the course of lives. These encounters often leave an indelible mark, carving a path towards self-discovery, growth, and fulfillment.\n\nOne such event for me occurred during my university studies. The mandatory international exchange program seemed daunting at first. The prospect of navigating a foreign culture, language barrier, and unfamiliar customs filled me with a mix of trepidation and excitement. Yet, it proved to be the most significant learning experience of my life.\n\nLanding in the heart of a vibrant, unfamiliar city, I was immediately immersed in a whirlwind of new experiences. The language barrier created an initial sense of isolation, forcing me to step outside my comfort zone and rely on my raw instincts to communicate. Every interaction, every meal, every cultural celebration became a learning opportunity. I had to adapt to different social norms, decipher unfamiliar customs, and forge new friendships.\n\nThe challenges I faced during this exchange program were immense. Yet, I discovered an unprecedented capacity for resilience and resourcefulness. I learned to navigate unfamiliar environments, solve problems independently, and embrace unfamiliar perspectives. Each day brought new lessons in cultural sensitivity, empathy, and communication.\n\nBeyond the practical skills, the exchange program fostered a profound sense of personal growth. I learned to step outside my comfort zone, embrace new challenges, and appreciate the diverse perspectives of others. The exposure to different lifestyles and ideologies broadened my horizons and ignited a thirst for knowledge. I returned home a changed individual, more open-minded, adaptable, and confident.\n\nThe impact of this transformative experience continues to reverberate throughout my life. The skills I learned have proven invaluable in my academic and professional pursuits. The newfound sense of independence and open-mindedness has allowed me to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and contribute meaningfully to society.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \"it changed my life\" encapsulates the profound impact of extraordinary experiences on human lives. Such encounters offer opportunities for personal growth, learning, and self-discovery, shaping the course of our destinies and enabling us to become better individuals."}
