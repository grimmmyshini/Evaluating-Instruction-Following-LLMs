This work showcases the artistic style of its creator, who aimed to capture human intellect and introspection. The sculpture was initially intended for the decorative panels of The Gates of Hell. Technically, this masterpiece was produced using the bronze casting process through the lost-wax technique. With a size of only 2 ft 4 in, The Thinker became a symbol of human intellectual curiosity and has had a significant cultural impact, inspiring numerous adaptations and replicas.\n\nOn the other hand, Michelangelo's David is an idealized masterpiece from the early 16th century during the High Renaissance, representing the power and strength of the human body. This sculpture was created using the marble carving technique. With a height of almost 17 ft, it was originally intended as a free-standing sculpture, commissioned by the city of Florence. The historical significance of David lies in its symbolism of the biblical hero preparing to fight Goliath and in Michelangelo's mastery of anatomy and proportion.\n\nAuguste Rodin and Michelangelo were two exceptional artists who left indelible marks on their respective eras. Rodin is recognized for his contribution to Modernism with works such as The Thinker, which represent human emotion and intellectual curiosity. Meanwhile, Michelangelo's David showcases the High Renaissance ideals of human beauty, anatomy, and proportion. Together, these masterpieces encapsulate the artistic evolution from the Middle Ages towards the modern era."}

It was designed by the engineer Gustave Eiffel and his company for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair). The land on which the tower stands was leased for a period of 20 years.\n\nThe first stone was laid on January 28, 1887, marking the beginning of its construction. The tower's iron framework, consisting of four massive piers and a series of arches, was completed in March 1889. On March 31, 1889, the Eiffel Tower's upper platform was reached for the first time, and the French flag was hoisted to the summit.\n\nThe tower was inaugurated on March 31, 1889. It held the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world until 1930. In 1898, a radio antenna was added to its summit for the Exposition Universelle Radiotelegraphique (World Radio Exhibition). During the First World War, it served as an observation post and radio communication center.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower underwent significant restoration between 1964 and 1985. It remains a major tourist attraction and a symbol of Paris and France. The tower is open year-round, except for a few days during the French national holidays when it is closed for maintenance."}

It sets off a chain reaction in them, just as a recipe card does for us. The chloroplasts open their 'shutter doors,' called stomata, to welcome sunlight into their workspace. Once the sunlight enters, it's like an artist's easel coming alive \u2013 the pigments within the chloroplasts called chlorophyll absorb the sunlight, converting it into energy, much like how paints are transformed into vibrant colors on a canvas.\n\nThis energy then becomes fuel for these chefs as they begin to cook up a unique dish: glucose, or sugar. They do this by combining sunlight's energy with carbon dioxide from the air and water absorbed through the plant's roots. This process is like baking a cake where the oven is the sun, the mixing bowl is the leaf, the eggs are carbon dioxide, and the flour is water!\n\nThe chloroplast chefs work in pairs \u2013 some focus on cooking up glucose using one type of sunlight while others create another essential ingredient: oxygen. Oxygen acts as a byproduct, much like how leavening agents produce carbon dioxide when baking bread. This oxygen is released into the atmosphere, contributing to the freshness of our surroundings, similar to how the aroma of freshly baked goods fills a kitchen.\n\nThroughout this entire process, think of the plant as a factory where energy production occurs in the leafy 'factory floor.' The energy produced, stored as ATP molecules, is then transported throughout the plant to fuel various functions \u2013 growth, repair, and even defense mechanisms. It's like the power generated at a central power station being distributed across a city.\n\nPhotosynthesis is an intricate dance of nature, where sunlight meets carbon dioxide, water, and chloroplast chefs.

In this article, we'll explore an exciting branch of science called plate tectonics. Ever heard about earthquakes and volcanic eruptions? Well, guess what? Plate tectonics is the reason behind these natural wonders! Let's dive in, shall we?\n\nSECTION 2: Understanding Plate Tectonics\nPlate tectonics is the scientific explanation of how Earth's crust is broken up into several large pieces or plates. These plates move, slide and interact with each other at their edges. There are three types of plate boundaries: Convergent (when plates collide), Divergent (when plates separate), and Transform (when plates slide past one another).\n\nSECTION 3: How Plate Tectonics Causes Earthquakes?\nWhen plates slide or grind against each other at convergent and transform boundaries, they create friction. This energy can build up over time until it's released in the form of an earthquake when the plates suddenly move.\n\nTrue or False: An earthquake is always caused by volcanic activity (False)\n\nSECTION 4: How Plate Tectonics Leads to Volcanic Eruptions?\nVolcanic eruptions occur at divergent and convergent plate boundaries, specifically when magma rises from deep within the Earth. As plates move apart, magma from beneath the Earth's surface can rise up and cause an eruption. Conversely, when plates collide, pressure builds up below them, causing volcanoes to form and eventually erupt.\n\nMultiple Choice: Where do volcanic eruptions typically occur at plate boundaries?\nA) Only at divergent plate boundaries\nB) Only at convergent plate boundaries\nC) Both at divergent and convergent plate boundaries (Answer: C)\n\nSECTION 5: Conclusion\nPlate tectonics is a fascinating part of geology that explains why we experience earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. By understanding this scientific concept, we can appreciate the dynamic nature of our planet. So next time you learn about earthquakes or witness an eruption on the news, remember: it's all part of plate tectonics in action!\n\nTrue or False: A volcano is always located at a convergent plate boundary (False)"}

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.\nWrite a title for the above paragraph.

The science of aerodynamics helps to design wings, stabilize flight, and minimize drag. One fundamental relationship in aerodynamics is Bernoulli's Equation, which relates the pressure difference between two points and the velocity difference between these points within a flowing fluid:\n\nP1 + 1/2\u03c1 * (V1)\u00b2 = P2 + 1/2\u03c1 * (V2)\u00b2\n\nwhere:\n- P is pressure,\n- \u03c1 is density of the fluid,\n- V is velocity,\n- subscripts 1 and 2 refer to points 1 and 2.\n\nSECTION 2: Propulsion\nPropulsion systems are essential for aerospace engineering, responsible for generating the forward motion or thrust required by aircraft and spacecraft. A widely used propulsion system in aviation is the Jet Engine, where fuel is burned inside a compressor to increase air pressure and temperature. The compressed air then interacts with an intake fan to produce thrust via exhaust gases expelled out the back of the engine.\n\nSECTION 3: Materials\nMaterial selection plays a significant role in aerospace engineering due to the challenging environments aircraft and spacecraft must operate within, such as high temperatures, pressures, and vacuum conditions. Below is a table summarizing some commonly used materials and their properties.\n\n| Material       | Properties                        | Application              |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Aluminum Alloys| Lightweight, Strong, Corrosion-resistant| Aircraft Structures      |\n| Carbon Fiber Composites| High strength-to-weight ratio, Stiffness  | Aircraft Primary Structures |\n| Titanium Alloys| High strength, Corrosion-resistant, Lightweight | Engines                   |\n| Ceramic Materials | High Temperature Resistance, Lightweight, Hard | Heat Shields              |\n\nSECTION 4: Control Systems\nControl systems in aerospace engineering ensure the stable and efficient flight of aircraft and spacecraft. These systems include the pitch, roll, yaw, and altitude control. A real-world example is the Fly-By-Wire (FBW) System, which digitally translates pilot inputs into electrical signals for controlling actuators to change the aircraft's attitude or position. FBW systems improve flight safety by minimizing human error while providing superior handling characteristics."}

On the other hand, Samsung maintained a steady presence, with slight growth from 31.6% to 27.8%. Xiaomi's market share significantly increased, surging from 9.9% in 2018 to 23.6% in 2020.\n\nFactors Affecting Market Shares (2018-2020)\n(Table 2)\n\n| Factors         | Apple                         | Samsung             | Xiaomi                |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Product Innovation| iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone SE2, iPad Pro| Galaxy S10, Note10, Z Fold2| Mi 9, Mi 10, Redmi Note 8 |\n| Pricing Strategies| Premium pricing                       | Wide range of prices     | Affordable and mid-range   |\n| Marketing Efforts  | Limited to high-end segment        | Targeted diverse segments | Aggressive global marketing|\n\nProduct Innovation: Apple introduced the iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone SE2, and iPad Pro during this period. These devices showcased improvements but did not bring groundbreaking changes compared to their competitors. Conversely, Samsung's product innovation included the Galaxy S10, Note10, and the Z Fold2 \u2013 the latter being a significant leap in the foldable phone market. Xiaomi capitalized on this with devices like Mi 9, Mi 10, and Redmi Note 8, which offered high-end features at budget prices.\n\nPricing Strategies: Apple has relied on premium pricing, maintaining a consistent brand image for quality and luxury. However, this pricing strategy did not resonate with all consumers, especially those looking for more affordable options, contributing to their market share decline. In contrast, Samsung catered to a wide range of price segments, allowing them to attract more customers than Apple and maintain their position in the market. Xiaomi's aggressive pricing strategy helped it gain significant market share, particularly among budget-conscious consumers.\n\nMarketing Efforts: Apple focuses on high-end customers with limited marketing efforts for its lower-priced devices. In contrast, Samsung targets diverse segments with various device categories and prices. Meanwhile, Xiaomi has employed aggressive global marketing strategies, which have led to the rapid expansion of its market share in Europe over the past three years.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple's declining market share can be attributed to a lack of groundbreaking product innovations compared to competitors and its reliance on premium pricing. Samsung maintained stability by catering to diverse segments with various devices and prices. Xiaomi capitalized on this trend by offering high-end features at affordable and mid-range prices and aggressively marketing its products worldwide."}

Include 3 primary suggestions. Ensure your response has at least 500 words.", "response": " Title: Protecting Indigenous Cultural Heritage through Sustainable Development: A Three-Pronged Approach\n\nIntroduction:\nRespecting and preserving the cultural heritage of indigenous communities is not only a moral imperative but also a critical component of sustainable development. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) recognizes that indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, protect, and have free access to their cultural heritage, including the traditional knowledge associated with it (Article 27). However, the pursuit of economic growth and development often threatens these fragile cultural ecosystems. In this policy proposal, we outline a three-pronged approach to safeguard indigenous cultural heritage while encouraging sustainable development.\n\n1. Collaborative Governance:\nThe first prong in our approach focuses on collaborative governance between governments and indigenous communities. This means actively involving indigenous peoples in the decision-making process regarding projects that may impact their cultural heritage sites. A consultative approach is necessary, as it empowers indigenous communities to have a say in how their ancestral lands are managed and developed. Furthermore, the implementation of free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) ensures that development initiatives do not infringe upon the cultural rights of indigenous peoples. This collaborative governance model allows for sustainable development projects that respect and preserve cultural heritage sites.\n\n2. Cultural Sensitivity in Development Projects:\nThe second prong in our approach focuses on integrating cultural sensitivity into development projects. Developers must consider the potential impact of their initiatives on indigenous cultural heritage sites and involve experts, such as anthropologists or linguists, to help mitigate any adverse effects. This could include the implementation of measures such as buffer zones, relocation of developments away from sensitive sites, or incorporating traditional practices into development plans. Moreover, projects could be designed to showcase indigenous cultural heritage and contribute to sustainable tourism. By taking a culturally sensitive approach, developers can reduce negative impacts on indigenous communities while ensuring that development initiatives align with their goals for long-term economic growth.\n\n3. Investment in Education and Training:\nThe third prong in our approach is focused on investing in education and training programs for indigenous communities. This investment could take the form of vocational training, language preservation initiatives, or academic scholarships. By providing educational opportunities to indigenous populations, they are equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to participate in economic development activities while preserving their cultural heritage. Additionally, by promoting cross-cultural education within society as a whole, there is a greater understanding and appreciation for indigenous communities and their unique traditions. This leads to more inclusive and equitable societies where sustainable development can coexist with the protection of indigenous cultural heritage.\n\nConclusion:\nBy implementing this three-pronged approach that prioritizes collaborative governance, cultural sensitivity in development projects, and investment in education and training for indigenous communities, we can ensure that economic development is pursued sustainably while preserving indigenous cultural heritage. This policy proposal not only aligns with the UNDRIP but also recognizes the inherent connection between respecting indigenous peoples' rights and fostering long-term sustainable growth. With a commitment to this approach from governments, NGOs, and businesses alike, we can work towards ensuring that indigenous communities are at the forefront of development initiatives that promote economic prosperity while preserving their cultural heritage for future generations."}

Ensure your response contains exactly 6 sections (Section 1, Section 2, Section 3, Section 4, Section 5 and Section 6).", "response": " **Section 1: Introduction**\n\nAn Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a psychological experiment used to measure the strength of automatic associations between concepts. In this case, we will design a simple IAT for assessing gender stereotypes. This test measures the association between specific concepts and genders, shedding light on implicit biases that might influence our thoughts, feelings, and actions towards males and females.\n\n**Section 2: Design of the Gender Stereotypes IAT**\n\nOur gender stereotypes IAT consists of four categories: Male (M), Female (F), Strong (S), and Weak (W). Participants are asked to associate each stimulus with the corresponding category as quickly and accurately as possible. The associations are as follows:\n\n1. Press 'E' for Males\n2. Press 'I' for Females\n3. Press 'E' for Strong Stimuli\n4. Press 'I' for Weak Stimuli\n\nThe order of the stimuli presentation is randomized between blocks to control for learning effects. There are typically two blocks: one where participants associate M with S and W with E (the \"compatible\" block), and another where they associate M with W and F with S (the \"incompatible\" block).\n\n**Section 3: Procedure for Conducting the Test**\n\n1. Provide instructions: Explain the purpose of the study, the IAT procedure, and the keypress assignments.\n2. Practice round: Allow participants to practice responding to all stimuli for correct categorization in the respective keys.\n3. Data collection: Present the stimuli blocks in a randomized order and record the latencies for each response (time taken to respond).\n4. Debriefing: After data collection, explain the true nature of the study, discussing potential biases and providing information about gender stereotypes.\n\n**Section 4: Example Table for Recording Test Results**\n\n|   | Compatible Block (M-S, W-E) | Incompatible Block (M-W, F-S) |\n|---|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Participant 1 |              208ms     |              325ms          |\n| Participant 2 |             246ms       |             -197ms           |\n| Participant 3 |             185ms       |              372ms          |\n| Participant 4 |             154ms       |              302ms          |\n| Participant 5 |            -138ms        |              268ms          |\n\n**Section 5: Interpreting the Results**\n\nTo analyze the results, we can calculate the mean difference in latency between the compatible and incompatible blocks. A smaller difference suggests a stronger association (compatibility effect), while a larger difference implies weaker or even reversed associations. For example, Participant 2's results show a strong negative compatibility effect (-197ms), potentially indicating an unconscious bias towards associating males with weakness.\n\n**Section 6: Conclusions and Limitations**\n\nThe IAT is a useful tool in assessing implicit biases related to gender stereotypes, but it does have limitations. These include individual differences, measurement error, and potential demand characteristics (participants guessing the true purpose of the study). Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution, ideally within the context of other data or research findings. The IAT provides valuable insight into unconscious biases; however, it does not determine the presence or absence of explicit biases or overall attitudes towards genders."}

The application of AI in healthcare spans from medical image analysis, clinical decision support systems, to patient monitoring and predictive analytics (1). However, despite the promising potential, the integration of AI into healthcare practice is still in its infancy, with numerous challenges needing to be addressed (2). In this research proposal, we propose a novel approach that utilizes AI to enhance healthcare outcomes by improving accuracy in diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.\n\nRelated Work:\nPrevious studies have explored the application of AI in healthcare, focusing primarily on medical image analysis for disease detection and diagnosis (3-5). For instance, deep learning algorithms have shown remarkable accuracy in diagnosing conditions such as pneumonia from chest X-rays (6) and skin cancer from dermoscopic images (7). However, these approaches only address one aspect of healthcare delivery.\n\nLimitation of Prior Work:\nA critical limitation of the current AI applications in healthcare is their narrow focus on diagnosis and lack of consideration for individualized treatment plans (2). Moreover, there are concerns regarding data privacy and security when transferring sensitive patient information to centralized systems (8).\n\nResearch Objectives:\nTo address these limitations, our research objective is threefold. First, we aim to develop an AI-based system capable of accurately diagnosing various diseases through analyzing clinical data, including medical history, laboratory results, and vital signs (9). Second, we will leverage machine learning algorithms to provide personalized treatment recommendations based on each patient's unique characteristics (10). Lastly, we will explore the potential use of decentralized blockchain technology to securely store and share patient data while maintaining privacy and confidentiality.\n\nProposed Methods:\nOur proposed methods involve developing an integrated AI system with two primary components. The first component is a diagnostic module that uses machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to analyze clinical data and generate accurate diagnoses (11). This will be achieved by training the model on a large dataset of electronic health records (EHR) to identify patterns and trends in patient data, thereby improving diagnosis accuracy over time.\n\nThe second component is a personalized treatment recommendation engine that uses patient-specific data, such as genetics, lifestyle, and environment, to generate tailored treatment plans (12). This will be achieved through the application of predictive analytics techniques and collaborative filtering algorithms, which can analyze historical patient data to identify successful treatments for similar patients.\n\nDistinctions from Previous Work:\nUnlike previous studies that focus solely on disease diagnosis using AI, our approach integrates both diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations in a unified system (13). Moreover, we propose the use of decentralized blockchain technology to securely store and share patient data while maintaining privacy, thus overcoming concerns regarding data security and confidentiality (14).\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, this research proposal outlines an innovative approach to enhancing healthcare outcomes through the development of a novel AI system capable of accurately diagnosing various diseases and providing personalized treatment recommendations based on each patient's unique characteristics. Our use of decentralized blockchain technology aims to overcome limitations in data privacy and security concerns. By integrating these components, we aim to develop an intelligent healthcare delivery system that can improve diagnostic accuracy, provide personalized care plans, and maintain patient privacy.\n\nReferences:\n[1] R.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.\n\nWrite a title for the above text in double angular brackets i.e. <<title>.

These are not mere passing events, but experiences that shape us, define us, and alter the trajectory of our journeys. I would like to share with you an account of one such experience that changed my life irrevocably.\n\nIt was a crisp autumn afternoon when I received news that would shatter the monotony of my existence: an unexpected inheritance from a long-lost relative. The sum was substantial enough to grant me the freedom to pursue any dream or desire I held dear. As I sat in the quietude of my home, absorbing this newfound reality, I felt an immense surge of excitement and trepidation.\n\nWith the wind of opportunity at my back, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery. I traveled to distant lands, immersing myself in diverse cultures and histories. I learned languages, made friends from all corners of the globe, and honed skills that lay dormant within me. Each day brought with it new experiences, challenges, and rewards, fueling my insatiable curiosity and thirst for knowledge.\n\nYet, amidst this whirlwind of adventure, there were moments of introspection where I grappled with the question: what truly mattered to me? In the hustle and bustle of life, it is easy to get lost in the pursuit of external validation or societal expectations. However, my transformative experience taught me that true fulfillment comes from within.\n\nI began to prioritize experiences over possessions, relationships over material wealth, and personal growth over accolades. Each day became a canvas upon which I painted my dreams, fears, and aspirations. And in the masterpiece of life, each stroke contributed towards creating a narrative that was uniquely mine.\n\nMoreover, this journey exposed me to the raw beauty of the world around me. The splendor of a sunset, the serenity of a still lake, or the joyous laughter of children playing in the streets - these simple pleasures held more value than any tangible treasure ever could. I realized that happiness is not something we search for externally but rather an internal state of being that arises from within us.\n\nAs I pen down these thoughts, I am reminded of a quote by Eleanor Roosevelt: \"To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart.\" My transformative experience has taught me the importance of both intellect and emotions in living a rich and meaningful life.\n\nIn conclusion, that fateful autumn afternoon marked the beginning of my metamorphosis from an aimless wanderer to a purposeful explorer. The inheritance I received served not as a source of financial security but as a catalyst for personal growth and self-discovery. It is my hope that by sharing this story, you too may find inspiration in the transformative power of experience and the infinite possibilities it holds within."}

It has four chambers - two atria (upper) and two ventricles (lower). The right side pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs for gas exchange, while the left side pumps oxygen-rich blood back into the body.\n\n2. **Blood Vessels**: The circulatory system includes three types of vessels - arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to organs and tissues; veins return deoxygenated blood back to the heart; capillaries facilitate gas exchange and nutrient absorption in the body's tissues.\n\n3. **Blood**: This liquid connective tissue is responsible for transporting various substances, including oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, nutrients, and waste products. It consists of plasma (a liquid) and formed elements such as red and white blood cells.\n\n**Section 2: Main Components and Their Functions - Detailed Description**\n\n1. **Heart**: The heart contracts and relaxes to maintain a continuous circulation of blood within the circulatory system.\n\n2. **Blood**: Blood transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products between organs and tissues through the circulatory system.\n\n3. **Arteries**: Thick-walled vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body.\n\n4. **Capillaries**: Thin-walled vessels where gas exchange (oxygen and carbon dioxide) occurs between the bloodstream and surrounding tissues.\n\n5. **Veins**: Large, thin-walled vessels that carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.\n\n**Section 3: Connection Between Main Components (Flowchart)**\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\nSubgraph Circulatory System\n    Heart --> \"Oxygen-rich blood\" ---> Arteries\n    Arteries --> Capillaries\n    Capillaries --> Tissues\n    Tissues --> Veins\n    Veins --> \"Deoxygenated blood\" ---> Heart\n\nSubgraph Gas Exchange\n    Capillaries --> Lungs\n    Lungs --> Oxygen-rich blood\n```\n\n**Section 4: Explanation of the Flowchart**\n\nThe circulatory system diagram consists of the heart as the main component, with arteries and veins connected to it.
