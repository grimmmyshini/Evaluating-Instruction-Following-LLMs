This process releases immense pressure and heat, leading to:\n\n* The melting of rock under the surface, forming magma.\n* The release of gases and volcanic material, such as lava, ash, and volcanic bombs.\n\n\n**Consequences of Plate Tectonics:**\n\nPlate tectonics is responsible for:\n\n* Approximately 95% of earthquakes worldwide.\n* Over 80% of volcanic eruptions on land.\n* The shaping of mountains and continents over time.\n\n\n**Quiz:**\n\n**1.

{"id": "29", "input": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "category": "Semantic Scholar", "instruction": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.", "decomposed_questions": ["Is the generated text a paper summary?", "Is the generated summary short and concise?", "Is the generated summary based on the given abstract?"], "subset": "Easy_set", "question_label": [["Format"], ["Style"], ["Content"]], "output": "**Summary:**\n\nThis paper tackles the few-shot learning (FSL) problem of dialogue understanding, focusing on joint intent detection and slot filling.

Aerodynamics**\n\nThe study of how air flows around and over structures is called aerodynamics. Bernoulli's equation governs the principles of aerodynamics:\n\n$$P + \\rho v^2 + \\rho g h = constant$$\n\nwhere P is pressure, \u03c1 is density, v is velocity, and h is height.\n\n\n**2. Propulsion**\n\nAcronym: ISP (Specific Impulse)\n\nThe process of generating force to overcome gravity and propel an aircraft is propulsion. Thrust is generated by engines, which convert energy into thrust. The ISP measures the efficiency of an engine, indicating the amount of impulse (change in momentum) generated per unit mass of fuel consumed.\n\n\n**3. Materials**\n\n| Material Type | Properties | Applications |\n|---|---|---|\n| Aluminum | Lightweight, strong | Aircraft fuselage, engine components |\n| Titanium | Highly resistant to fatigue and corrosion | Aircraft structural components, space vehicles |\n| Carbon Fiber | Stiffness, high strength-to-weight ratio | Aircraft wings, helicopter blades |\n\n\n**4. Control Systems**\n\nExample: Autopilot in Aircraft\n\nControl systems allow pilots to manipulate the aircraft's attitude and trajectory automatically. Autopilots use sensors and feedback mechanisms to detect and correct deviations from desired flight parameters. This technology enhances pilot workload and improves flight safety, particularly during takeoff and landing."}

Participants are presented with pairs of words (e.g., \"strong - feminine,\" \"independent - dependent\") and asked to rate how much they agree with statements linking the words (e.g., \"strong things are usually feminine\").\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1. Participants are instructed that the test measures unconscious associations and responses will be completely anonymous.\n2. The IAT consists of 4 blocks of trials:\n    - **Positive-Neutral:** Pairs linking positive words with neutral words.\n    - **Positive-Positive:** Pairs linking positive words with positive words.\n    - **Negative-Neutral:** Pairs linking negative words with neutral words.\n    - **Negative-Positive:** Pairs linking negative words with positive words.\n3. For each pair, participants rate the degree of agreement with a sentence connecting the two words (e.g., \"Strong things are usually feminine\"). \n4. Responses are recorded on a 7-point Likert scale.\n\n**Table: IAT Results**\n\n| Block | Word 1 | Word 2 | Response |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Positive-Neutral | Strong | Feminine | Agree |\n| Positive-Positive | Strong | Independent | Disagree |\n| Negative-Neutral | Weak | Feminine | Agree |\n| Negative-Positive | Weak | Independent | Disagree |\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe results are analyzed using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) scores, which measure the difference between the average agreement to Positive-Positive and Negative-Positive pairs minus the average of Positive-Neutral and Negative-Neutral pairs.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n- A positive IAT score suggests an implicit association between the positive words and the positive gender category, and between the negative words and the negative gender category. This implies the presence of a gender stereotype favoring the positive gender.\n- A negative IAT score suggests the opposite association, indicating an implicit rejection of the traditional gender stereotypes.\n\n**Hypothetical Results:**\n\n- A large positive IAT score suggests strong implicit gender stereotype endorsement.\n- A small positive IAT score suggests mild endorsement.\n- A negative IAT score suggests rejection of traditional gender stereotypes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe IGST provides insight into the unconscious attitudes towards gender held by individuals. The test can be used to assess the prevalence of gender stereotypes in society and the effectiveness of interventions to promote gender equality."}

{"id": "82", "input": "Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim.
