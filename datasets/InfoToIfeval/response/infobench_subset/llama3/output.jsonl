By repeatedly focusing on your physical body and surroundings, you'll learn to acknowledge and accept your emotions while cultivating a sense of calm.\n\n**Step-by-step instructions:**\n\n1. **Find a quiet, comfortable space**: Sit or lie down in a spot where you feel safe and won't be distracted.\n2. **Focus on your breath**: Take slow, deliberate breaths, feeling the air move in and out of your body. Try to release any tension as you exhale.\n3. **Notice physical sensations**: Pay attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground or the surface beneath you. Notice the texture, temperature, and any pressure points.\n4. **Bring awareness to your entire body**: Starting from your toes, gradually bring your attention to each part of your body (feet, ankles, legs, torso, arms, hands, neck, face). Notice any physical sensations, feelings of relaxation or tension, without judgment.\n5. **Anchoring the present**: As you focus on your body, silently repeat the phrase \"I am here\" (or a similar anchor phrase) to yourself. This helps solidify your connection to the present moment.\n6. **Introduce a sensory distraction**: Choose an object within arm's reach (e.g., a pen, a book, or a small toy). Focus on the texture, shape, color, and any other sensory details of this object. Use this distraction to momentarily shift your attention away from anxious thoughts.\n7. **Repeat the process**: Continue cycling through these steps as needed. Each time you return to your breath, body scan, or sensory distraction, acknowledge any lingering anxiety and gently bring yourself back to the present moment.\n\n**Why it works:** The Anxiety Anchor exercise helps in several ways:\n\n1. **Grounds you in the present**: By focusing on your physical body and surroundings, you're anchored in the present moment, reducing worries about the past or future.\n2. **Decreases rumination**: Regularly interrupting anxious thoughts with sensory distractions reduces the tendency to ruminate on negative thoughts.\n3. **Increases mindfulness**: This exercise cultivates mindfulness by encouraging awareness of physical sensations and surroundings, promoting a greater sense of calm.\n4. **Builds self-compassion**: By acknowledging and accepting your emotions without judgment, you're practicing self-compassion and developing a more positive relationship with yourself.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Start small and practice the Anxiety Anchor exercise for 5-10 minutes daily. Gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable.\n* Incorporate calming music or nature sounds to enhance your experience.\n* Adapt this exercise to suit your needs by using different objects, such as a favorite item or a stress ball, for sensory distraction.\n* Practice the Anxiety Anchor in various settings (e.g., at work, before bed) to build confidence and mastery.\n\n**Remember:** Managing anxiety is an ongoing process. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to explore other relaxation techniques or seek professional help if you need additional support."}

It's a fascinating topic that explains many of the amazing geological features we see in our world, including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nSo, what is plate tectonics?\n\nImagine the Earth's surface as a giant puzzle. The puzzle pieces are called tectonic plates, and they fit together to form the outer layer of our planet. These plates are always moving, sometimes slipping past each other quietly, and other times colliding with a loud crash.\n\nThere are several types of plate movements:\n\n* **Divergent movement**: When two plates move apart from each other, new crust forms as magma rises to fill the gap. This is how mid-ocean ridges and mountain ranges like the Andes were created.\n* **Convergent movement**: When two plates collide, one plate gets pushed beneath another, a process called subduction. This can cause earthquakes and volcanoes. Imagine two giant puzzle pieces colliding \u2013 it's like that!\n* **Transform movement**: When two plates slide past each other horizontally, without creating or destroying any crust.\n\nNow, let's talk about earthquakes!\n\nWhen tectonic plates move against each other, they can get stuck. As they continue to move, stress builds up until suddenly... BAM! The Earth's crust snaps back into place, causing the ground to shake \u2013 an earthquake!\n\nVolcanic eruptions are also connected to plate movement. When two plates converge and one gets pushed beneath another (subduction), the overlying plate is stretched and thinned. As it becomes too thin, magma rises to fill the gap, sometimes erupting as a volcano!\n\n**Quiz:**\n\n1. What happens when tectonic plates collide?\na) They slide past each other quietly.\nb) One plate gets pushed beneath another (subduction).\nc) New crust forms as magma rises.\n\nAnswer: b) One plate gets pushed beneath another (subduction).\n\n2. What is the process called when two plates move apart and new crust forms?\na) Convergent movement\nb) Divergent movement\nc) Transform movement\n\nAnswer: b) Divergent movement\n\n3. Why do earthquakes occur?\na) When tectonic plates collide.\nb) When one plate gets pushed beneath another.\nc) When magma rises to fill a gap.\n\nAnswer: a) When tectonic plates collide.\n\nTrue or False:\n\n1. The Earth's surface is made up of fixed puzzle pieces, and nothing moves.\n\nFalse! The tectonic plates are always moving!\n\n2. Volcanoes only form when two plates converge and one gets pushed beneath another (subduction).\n\nFalse! Volcanoes can also form when a plate is pulled apart or slides past another plate.\n\nI hope you now have a better understanding of how plate tectonics contributes to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions!"}

{"id": "29", "input": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "category": "Semantic Scholar", "instruction": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.", "decomposed_questions": ["Is the generated text a paper summary?", "Is the generated summary short and concise?", "Is the generated summary based on the given abstract?"], "subset": "Easy_set", "question_label": [["Format"], ["Style"], ["Content"]], "output": "The FewJoint benchmark is introduced for few-shot learning (FSL) in dialogue understanding, which jointly learns intent detection and slot filling tasks.

The shape and movement of an object can create pressure differences and friction, which affect its flight performance.\n\nKey equation:\n\n* Lift (L) = \u00bd \u03c1 v^2 A\n\nWhere L is lift, \u03c1 is air density, v is velocity, and A is the wing area.\n\n**Principle 2: Propulsion**\n\nRelevant abbreviation: Isp (full form: Specific Impulse)\n\nIsp is a measure of the efficiency of a rocket's propulsion system. It represents the amount of thrust produced per unit of propellant consumed. For example, an Isp value of 300 seconds indicates that one kilogram of propellant produces 300 seconds worth of thrust.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nIn aerospace engineering, propulsion systems are designed to generate thrust and counteract the forces of drag (air resistance) and gravity. The choice of propulsion system depends on the specific application, such as aircraft, spacecraft, or missiles. For instance, a commercial airliner might use jet engines, while a satellite would rely on solar panels or onboard power sources.\n\n**Principle 3: Materials**\n\nHere is a table summarizing some common materials used in aerospace engineering:\n\n| Material | Properties | Applications |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Aluminum | Lightweight, corrosion-resistant | Aircraft structures, engine components |\n| Titanium | High strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion-resistant | Engine components, fasteners, and structural parts |\n| Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) | High strength, stiffness, and light weight | Aerospace structures, such as wings and fuselages |\n| Ceramic matrix composite (CMC) | High-temperature resistance, lightweight | Heat shields and thermal protection systems |\n\n**Principle 4: Control Systems**\n\nReal-world example:\n\nImagine a commercial airliner cruising at an altitude of 30,000 feet. The pilot wants to descend to 10,000 feet for landing. To do this, the autopilot system adjusts the aircraft's pitch, roll, and yaw angles to control the rate of descent while maintaining stable flight.\n\nIn this scenario, the control systems principle involves using sensors and actuators (such as flaps, ailerons, and rudder) to regulate the aircraft's flight trajectory. This ensures safe and efficient operation, taking into account factors like airspeed, altitude, and heading."}

While the company still produces high-quality products, its product innovation has slowed down, with the iPhone 12 series not being as revolutionary as previous years. Additionally, Apple's pricing strategy remains premium, which may deter price-sensitive consumers from opting for an iPhone.\n\nSamsung, on the other hand, has been gaining ground by investing in product innovation and marketing efforts. The Galaxy S21 and Note20 series received positive reviews, attracting customers looking for high-end features at a competitive price point. Samsung's pricing strategy has become more aggressive, especially in mid-range segments, making its products more appealing to budget-conscious consumers.\n\nXiaomi has been the dark horse of the three companies, rapidly increasing its market share. The company has focused on offering affordable products with impressive specifications, leveraging social media and online advertising to reach a wider audience. Xiaomi's pricing strategy is highly competitive, driving sales volume and attracting price-sensitive consumers.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple's decline in market share can be attributed to a slowdown in product innovation and a premium pricing strategy. Samsung's growth is due to its focus on product innovation and aggressive marketing efforts. Xiaomi's rapid rise is driven by its competitive pricing strategy and effective marketing efforts."}

Crises are often time-sensitive and require immediate attention, whereas adversities can be more long-term or chronic.\n\nExample sentence: \"The company was in crisis mode when their main customer suddenly pulled out.\"\n\n5. **Obstacle**: An obstacle is an impediment or challenge that must be overcome. While obstacles can be seen as a type of adversity, the term emphasizes the need to find a way around or over the challenge, rather than simply enduring it.\n\nExample sentence: \"The team had to navigate several obstacles on their way to winning the championship.\"\n\n6. **Challenge**: A challenge is an opportunity to prove oneself or demonstrate one's abilities. While challenges can be difficult or even daunting, they are often seen as a positive and growth-oriented experience, whereas adversities can be more negative and draining.\n\nExample sentence: \"The team was excited to take on the toughest opponent of the season.\"\n\nIn summary, while these synonyms share some similarities with \"adversity,\" each has its own nuances in terms of connotation, scope, and usage."}

Participants are presented with a series of pairs consisting of a name (either male or female) followed by a trait (either positive or negative). The participant's task is to categorize each pair as either \"good\" or \"bad\".\n2. In the initial phase (Blocks A and B), participants are shown half-male and half-female names, with positive and negative traits.\n3. In the subsequent phases (Blocks C and D), the same traits are presented, but with male and female labels randomly assigned to the traits (e.g., \"he is kind\" or \"she is mean\").\n4. Participants' responses are recorded, and their reaction time is measured for each pair.\n\n**Test Results Table:**\n\n| Block # | Name/Trait Pair | Response Time (in seconds) | Correct/Incorrect |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A1 | John/happy | 0.6 | Correct |\n| A2 | Sarah/aggressive | 0.7 | Incorrect |\n| B3 | David/careless | 0.5 | Correct |\n| B4 | Emily/intelligent | 0.8 | Correct |\n| C1 | He/creative | 0.9 | Correct |\n| C2 | She/musical | 1.0 | Incorrect |\n| D3 | She/hardworking | 0.7 | Correct |\n| D4 | He/empathetic | 0.5 | Correct |\n\n**Hypothetical Test Results:**\n\nHere's a table with hypothetical test results for three participants:\n\n| Participant | Block A Mean Response Time (seconds) | Block B Mean Response Time (seconds) | Block C Mean Response Time (seconds) | Block D Mean Response Time (seconds) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alice | 0.6 | 0.7 | 1.2 | 0.8 |\n| Bob | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.9 | 0.6 |\n| Charlie | 0.7 | 0.8 | 1.1 | 0.9 |\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nTo analyze the results, we'll focus on the mean response times for each block and calculate the differences between adjacent blocks (Block A vs. Block B, Block C vs. D).\n\n**Differences Between Adjacent Blocks:**\n\n| Participant | Block A to Block B Difference (seconds) | Block C to Block D Difference (seconds) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Alice | 0.1 (faster) | -0.3 (slower) |\n| Bob | -0.1 (slower) | -0.3 (slower) |\n| Charlie | 0.1 (faster) | -0.2 (slower) |\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nFor Alice, the faster response time in Block A and slower response time in Block C suggest that she may have an implicit association between women and positive traits, but also a tendency to associate men with more creative qualities.\n\nBob's results indicate a slower response time for male names in Block B, suggesting a potential negative bias towards males. In Block D, Bob takes longer to categorize \"She\" with the trait \"hardworking\", implying a possible stereotype that women are not typically associated with this characteristic.\n\nCharlie's responses show no clear pattern of implicit associations, indicating that their biases might be more neutral or context-dependent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe IAT results provide insights into participants' unconscious stereotypes and biases. Alice may hold benevolent but limited views about women, while Bob's results suggest a negative bias towards males. Charlie's neutral responses imply an openness to diverse characteristics for both men and women. These findings can be useful in understanding gender-related attitudes and behaviors, as well as developing targeted interventions to promote greater inclusivity and reduce stereotype-driven biases."}

The store uses a fixed set of denominations: quarters ($0.25), dimes ($0.10), nickels ($0.05), and pennies ($0.01).\n\n**Problem Statement:** Given an amount of money (in cents) as input, write a program that returns the minimum number of coins needed to make change for that amount using the available denominations.\n\n**Example Inputs and Outputs:**\n\n* Input: 37\nOutput: 4 (3 quarters, 1 nickel, and 2 pennies)\n* Input: 92\nOutput: 8 (7 dimes, 1 quarter, and 2 pennies)\n* Input: 201\nOutput: 15 (12 quarters, 3 pennies)\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n* The input amount will be a positive integer between 1 and 1000.\n* You can use each denomination as many times as needed.\n* You cannot use a coin with a value greater than the remaining change.\n\n**Dynamic Programming Approach:** To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to build up a table of minimum coin combinations for amounts from 1 to 1000. The key observation is that the optimal solution for an amount `x` can be constructed by considering the optimal solutions for smaller amounts, such as `x - 25` (using a quarter) or `x - 10` (using a dime).\n\n**Table Structure:**\n\n* Create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(1001, 4)` to store the minimum number of coins needed to make change for each amount from 0 to 1000.\n* Initialize all elements in `dp` to infinity except for `dp[0][0]`, which is set to 0 (since no coins are needed to make change for an amount of 0).\n\n**Recurrence Relation:**\n\n* For each `i` from 1 to 1000, consider the minimum number of coins needed to make change for amounts `i - 25`, `i - 10`, and `i - 5`.\n* If using a quarter (`25`) results in a smaller number of coins than the current best solution, update the table with this new combination.\n* Repeat the process for dimes (`10`), nickels (`5`), and pennies (`1`).\n\n**Final Solution:**\n\n* Once the `dp` table is fully populated, find the minimum value in the last row (corresponding to the input amount).\n* Construct the optimal coin combination by tracing back from this minimum value to the first non-infinite value.\n\nThis dynamic programming approach allows you to efficiently solve the problem and return the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount."}

AI-powered systems have the potential to transform patient care by providing personalized treatment plans, streamlining clinical workflows, and improving disease diagnosis and management. Despite the growing interest in AI-assisted healthcare, there is a need for a comprehensive approach that addresses the complexities of real-world healthcare settings.\n\nRelated Work:\nPrevious studies have explored AI's role in enhancing healthcare outcomes, focusing on specific applications such as natural language processing-based chatbots (1), machine learning-based disease diagnosis (2), and rule-based decision support systems (3). While these efforts demonstrate promising results, they are often limited to isolated scenarios or small-scale pilots. Furthermore, many studies rely heavily on simulated data, which may not accurately reflect the complexities of real-world healthcare environments.\n\nLimitations of Prior Work:\nExisting AI-powered healthcare solutions often suffer from limitations such as:\n\n1. Insufficient generalizability: Many studies rely on small, homogeneous datasets that may not generalize well to diverse patient populations.\n2. Lack of domain expertise: AI algorithms are often trained on datasets without considering the nuances of clinical decision-making and patient-specific factors.\n3. Inadequate user engagement: Patients and healthcare professionals are not fully incorporated into AI-assisted workflows, leading to potential biases and reduced adoption rates.\n\nResearch Objectives:\nThis study aims to overcome the limitations of prior work by developing a comprehensive framework for enhancing healthcare outcomes using artificial intelligence. The primary objectives are:\n\n1. To design and validate a novel AI-powered clinical decision support system that incorporates domain expertise from healthcare professionals.\n2. To develop a user-centered approach that engages patients and healthcare professionals in AI-assisted workflows.\n3. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in real-world healthcare settings.\n\nProposed Methods:\nTo address the limitations of prior work, we propose a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. Domain Expertise Integration: We will collaborate with healthcare professionals to develop AI algorithms that incorporate their expertise and clinical decision-making patterns.\n2. User-Centered Design: Our design process will involve iterative feedback from patients and healthcare professionals to ensure user acceptance and usability of AI-assisted workflows.\n3. Real-World Data Collection: We will collect data from diverse patient populations and healthcare settings to evaluate the generalizability and effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n\nDistinguishing Features:\nOur approach differs from previous work in several key aspects:\n\n1. Domain Expertise Integration: Unlike existing AI-powered systems, we will incorporate domain expertise directly into our algorithm development process.\n2. User-Centered Design: Our design process prioritizes patient and healthcare professional engagement, ensuring that AI-assisted workflows are user-friendly and effective.\n3. Real-World Data Collection: By collecting data from diverse real-world settings, we will evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in actual clinical practice.\n\nBy addressing the limitations of prior work and incorporating domain expertise, user-centered design, and real-world data collection, this study aims to establish a comprehensive framework for enhancing healthcare outcomes using artificial intelligence. The proposed approach has the potential to revolutionize patient care by providing personalized treatment plans, improving disease diagnosis and management, and streamlining clinical workflows.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

{"id": "82", "input": "Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "category": "Wikipedia", "instruction": "Summarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.", "decomposed_questions": ["Is the generated text a summary of the article in the given input?", "Is the generated summary concise?", "Does the generated text summarize the main points of the article in the given input?", "Does the generated text only include information that is present in the given article?"], "subset": "Easy_set", "question_label": [["Format", "Content"], ["Style"], ["Content"], ["Content"]], "output": "The article discusses the relationship between mathematics and art, highlighting examples from ancient to modern times where artists have used mathematical concepts such as proportions, geometry, perspective, and tessellation in their work.

It was an eye-opening opportunity that not only broadened my perspective but also instilled a newfound sense of purpose within me.\n\nAs soon as I arrived, I was struck by the stark contrast between the poverty-stricken surroundings and the warmth of the people. The children's laughter echoed through the dusty streets as they played with makeshift toys made from plastic bottles and sticks. The women's hands moved deftly as they wove colorful fabrics on ancient looms, their eyes twinkling with pride.\n\nMy days were filled with a mix of physical labor and educational activities. I helped construct new homes for families who had lost theirs to natural disasters, my hammer swinging in rhythmic unison with the chatter of the local volunteers. In the evenings, we'd gather around candles and share stories, our words weaving a tapestry of hope and resilience.\n\nOne particular moment stood out as a turning point. I was working alongside a young girl, her eyes shining like dark diamonds as she showed me how to craft intricate patterns on a hand-loom. As we worked in silence, the weight of her struggles became palpable \u2013 the lack of resources, the absence of opportunity, and the quiet determination that drove her forward.\n\nIn that instant, I realized that our lives are intertwined, linked by threads of hope and resilience. The experience was a poignant reminder that even in the midst of adversity, there is always beauty to be found, always a chance for growth and transformation.\n\nThe three weeks flew by, leaving me with an indelible mark on my soul. Upon returning home, I felt an insatiable hunger to continue making a difference, to use my skills to empower others and bring about positive change. It was as if the experience had awakened a part of me that had been dormant, urging me to take action and make the most of this precious life.\n\nThe experience changed my life by opening my eyes to the reality of global disparities and igniting a passion within me to work towards bridging those gaps. It taught me the value of community, the power of human connection, and the transformative impact that even small acts of kindness can have. And as I look back on that life-changing experience, I am reminded of the profound words of Nelson Mandela: \"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.\""}

The heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body through veins and pumps it into arteries.\n2. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body, releasing oxygen and nutrients to tissues and organs.\n3. Capillaries allow for gas exchange, where oxygen and nutrients are taken in by cells and carbon dioxide and waste products are removed.\n4. Veins collect deoxygenated blood from capillaries and transport it back to the heart.\n5. The heart pumps this deoxygenated blood back out into the arteries, completing the circulation cycle.\n\nThis flowchart illustrates the continuous loop of blood flow through the human circulatory system."}

Here are some examples of Python loop codes:\n\n**1. For Loop**\n\nA `for` loop in Python is used when you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n\nExample:\n```\nfruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n```\n\n**2. While Loop**\n\nA `while` loop in Python is used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.\n\nExample:\n```\ni = 0\nwhile i < 5:\n    print(i)\n    i += 1\n```\n\n**3. Do-While Loop**\n\nThere isn't a native `do-while` loop in Python, but you can use a combination of a `while` loop and an `if` statement to achieve the same effect.\n\nExample:\n```\ni = 0\nwhile True:\n    print(i)\n    if i >= 5:\n        break\n    i += 1\n```\n\n**4. List Comprehension**\n\nA list comprehension in Python is a concise way to create a new list from an existing one, using a loop.\n\nExample:\n```\nsquares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]\nprint(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n```\n\n**5. Looping through Dictionary**\n\nYou can loop through a dictionary in Python to iterate over its key-value pairs.\n\nExample:\n```\nperson = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}\nfor key, value in person.items():\n    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n```\n\nThese are just a few examples of Python loops."}
