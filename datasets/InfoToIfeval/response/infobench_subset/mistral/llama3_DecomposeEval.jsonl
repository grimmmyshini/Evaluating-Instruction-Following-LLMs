Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down with your back supported. Close your eyes if you prefer, or keep them open but soften your gaze.\n\n2. Begin by taking three slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Feel your belly rise as you inhale and fall as you exhale. Notice the sensation of air entering and leaving your nostrils.\n\n3. Start counting each inhale (1) and exhale (2).

As you continue to breathe, bring your attention to the present moment. Notice any physical sensations, such as tension in your muscles or warmth on your skin.\n\n5. Now shift your focus to a peaceful and relaxing mental image, such as a serene landscape, a cozy cabin, or any place that makes you feel calm and at ease.

Journaling cards or tags (for adding captions or stories)\n8. Ruler and pencil (to measure and mark placement of elements)\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Choose your base: Select a sheet of scrapbook paper to serve as the foundation for your layout. This will be the background against which your photos, embellishments, and other design elements will stand out.\n\n2. Plan and prepare: Arrange your photos and decorative elements on the back of the scrapbook paper in a way that pleases you. This step allows you to visualize the final product before committing anything to the page.\n\n3. Adhere your photos: Apply adhesive to the backs of your photos, either using double-sided tape, glue sticks, or adhesive squares. Place them on the paper in their intended positions, making sure they are evenly spaced and well-aligned.\n\n4. Add decorative elements: Carefully place your stickers, die cuts, embellishments, and washi tapes around the photos, following the design you created during the planning stage. Be mindful of balance and consistency in size and placement.\n\n5. Journaling time: If desired, write captions or add stories to your layout using journaling cards or tags. Apply adhesive to the backs of these elements and place them next to or near relevant photos.\n\n6. Tidy up: Trim any excess paper or decorative elements that extend beyond the edges of your layout. This will give it a clean, polished appearance.\n\n7. Final touches: If necessary, adjust the placement of any elements to achieve perfect alignment and symmetry. Once you're satisfied with the final product, let everything dry completely before closing the scrapbook or displaying your creation.\n\nTips for Beginners:\n- Experiment with different styles, materials, and techniques to find what works best for you.\n- Don't be afraid to mix and match patterns, colors, and textures.\n- Keep a well-stocked supply of adhesive on hand to prevent running out in the middle of a project.\n- Take your time and enjoy the creative process \u2013 remember, there are no mistakes, only opportunities for new discoveries!", "eval": [true, false, true, true, true]}

Today, we are going to take a fascinating journey below the surface of our planet, where continents move and mountains rise. Buckle up as we learn about plate tectonics!\n\nPlate tectonics is the scientific explanation for how Earth's outer layer, the lithosphere, moves like giant puzzle pieces. The lithosphere consists of seven main plates: the North American, South American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Australian, and Pacific plates. Each plate can be as large as a continent or an ocean floor!\n\nThe movement of these plates is not a sudden sprint but rather a slow dance over millions of years. They may push against each other (convergent boundary), move apart from one another (divergent boundary), or slide next to each other (transform boundary). Let's see what happens at each of these boundaries:\n\n1. Convergent Boundary: When two plates collide, one plate will either be forced under the other (subduction) or they both will crash together and push up the land forming mountains (orogeny). This is where mountain ranges like the Himalayas and the Andes are formed!\n\n2. Divergent Boundary: When plates move apart, molten rock from inside the Earth rises to fill the gap, creating new ocean floor or extending continents. You can see this action at places like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean and the East African Rift Valley.\n\n3. Transform Boundary: Here, plates slide past one another horizontally. The San Andreas Fault in California is an example of a transform boundary.\n\nNow you know how plate tectonics shape our world, but what does it have to do with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions? Well, most earthquakes occur at convergent or divergent boundaries as stress builds up along the edges of moving plates. When enough stress builds up and is released in a sudden jolt, an earthquake happens!\n\nVolcanoes are often found at divergent and convergent boundaries because magma from inside the Earth rises more easily when plates are moving apart or colliding. As the molten rock reaches the surface, it can erupt as lava or explosively as ash and gas.\n\nQuiz Time! Let's check your understanding of plate tectonics:\n\n1. What happens at a divergent boundary?\n   A) Plates move apart from each other\n   B) Plates collide with each other\n   C) Plates slide past each other horizontally\n   D) None of the above\n   Answer: A) Plates move apart from each other\n\n2. What kind of earthquake activity is most common at a convergent boundary?\n   A) Volcanic eruptions\n   B) Earthquakes due to plate collisions\n   C) Earthquakes due to plate sliding horizontally\n   D) None of the above\n   Answer: B) Earthquakes due to plate collisions\n\n3. Which plate boundary is not associated with volcanic activity?\n   A) Convergent boundary\n   B) Divergent boundary\n   C) Transform boundary\n   D) All boundaries can have volcanic activity\n   Answer: C) Transform boundary\n\nTrue or False:\n\n4. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is an example of a divergent boundary. (True)\n5. Mountains form at transform boundaries. (False)\n\nCongratulations on learning about plate tectonics, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions!

However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "category": "Semantic Scholar", "instruction": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.", "decomposed_questions": ["Is the generated text a paper summary?", "Is the generated summary short and concise?", "Is the generated summary based on the given abstract?"], "subset": "Easy_set", "question_label": [["Format"], ["Style"], ["Content"]], "output": " Title: FewJoint: A Few-Shot Learning Benchmark for Joint Dialogue Understanding\n\nAbstract Summary: This paper introduces FewJoint, a new few-shot learning benchmark for joint dialogue understanding focusing on intent detection and slot filling.

Aerodynamics: The study of how air moves around an object, particularly aircraft. An associated equation to understand aerodynamic lift (F\\_l) is Bernoulli's principle, which states that the pressure (p) in a fluid at rest decreases as the velocity (v) increases or, conversely, the velocity increases as the pressure decreases according to the relationship: p1 + 0.5\u03c1(v1)^2 = p2 + 0.5\u03c1(v2)^2, where \u03c1 is the fluid density.\n\n2. Propulsion: The driving force that moves an aerospace vehicle. A common propulsion method is jet propulsion (JP), defined as a type of reaction propulsion in which a jet of fluid (gas) expelled from the rear of a vehicle creates thrust to move it forward. In the subsequent discussion, Jet Propulsion (JP) will be used as an abbreviation.\n\n3.

Control Systems: A system that enables an aircraft to maintain its desired course and altitude while responding appropriately to environmental conditions. For example, the autopilot system on a commercial airplane uses various sensors to gather information about the plane's position, speed, and altitude. The autopilot then adjusts control surfaces such as ailerons, elevators, or rudders to keep the aircraft on its planned course or to respond to changes in flight conditions.

In contrast, Apple's market share decreased by 3 percentage points from 2018 to 2020.\n\nTable 2 highlights key data points that correlate with the rise or decline in market shares based on the factors mentioned above:\n\n| Year | Company   | Product Innovation  | Pricing Strategy   | Marketing Efforts   |\n|------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 2018 | Apple    | iPhone XS and XR launched | High-end pricing | Strong marketing campaigns (Super Bowl ads)   |\n|       | Samsung  | Galaxy S9 and Note 9 released   | Premium pricing   | Wide distribution network and marketing in major markets  |\n|       | Xiaomi  | Mi Mix 3 with slider display launched | Competitive pricing  | Strong online presence and aggressive promotions |\n| 2019 | Apple   | iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 launched | Mixed pricing (flagship at high-end) | Continued marketing efforts, emphasis on camera features |\n|       | Samsung  | Galaxy S10 series released    | Premium pricing   | Marketing push for foldable Galaxy Fold |\n|       | Xiaomi  | Mi 9 Pro with triple camera and 5G launched | Competitive pricing   | Continued growth in Europe through partnerships and pop-up stores |\n| 2020 | Apple  | iPhone SE (2nd gen) introduced at affordable price | Mixed pricing (affordable model) | Intense focus on online retail due to pandemic restrictions |\n|       | Samsung  | Galaxy S20 series released   | High-end pricing   | Emphasis on foldable technology and 5G capabilities |\n|       | Xiaomi  | Mi 10 series with 108MP camera launched | Competitive pricing | Continued expansion in European markets |\n\nIn the past three years, Apple's decline can be attributed to a lack of innovative products at competitive prices compared to Samsung and Xiaomi. Although Apple continued marketing efforts, their focus on high-end devices has failed to resonate with a wider audience in Europe.\n\nSamsung maintains its market lead through consistent product innovation, such as foldable displays and 5G capabilities, which have kept the company relevant in the premium segment. Their strong distribution network and marketing efforts across major markets have also contributed to their success.\n\nXiaomi's rapid growth can be attributed to competitive pricing and a focus on product innovation to appeal to European consumers. The company has effectively leveraged its online presence for aggressive promotions, which has proven successful in capturing market share from both Apple and Samsung.\n\nIn conclusion, the European smartphone market is a battleground between Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi, with each company vying for dominance through product innovation, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts. While Apple struggles to adapt to the shifting market dynamics, Samsung maintains its lead due to consistent product innovation and strong distribution networks. Meanwhile, Xiaomi's growth demonstrates the potential of competitive pricing and strategic marketing to seize market share in a crowded European smartphone landscape.", "eval": [true, false, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true]}

Let's solve it step by step:\n\n1. In the top-right corner, we know that there must be a 2 somewhere in the second row because both the first and third rows contain a 1 already. So let's put it in the middle of the second row (2|_|_).\n\n2. Now, in the fourth row and fifth column, since this is the only empty square in the rightmost column, and we know that the number 8 must be somewhere in the bottom-right corner because there are no other possibilities for it, let's put it here (6|1|_|_|_|5|4|3|7).\n\n3. In the third row and sixth column, we can place a 9 because only that number is left to complete this column. Also, since the second row already has a 2 in it, the fifth column cannot have a 2 as well (8|3|4|6|7|_|9|_|_).\n\n4. In the seventh row and eighth column, since we know that there must be an 8 somewhere in this row, let's place it at the bottom (5|4| | | | | |9|8).\n\n5. Now, focusing on the fourth and fifth columns, we can see that if there was a 6 in the second row, then the fifth column must have a 2 because the third row already has a 1. Since it's not possible for a 6 to be in the first row due to the presence of a 4 (which shares the same row with 6 and can only have values between 1-3), let's place a 2 in the fifth column (|_|9|7|2| |8|3|7|6).\n\n6. In the first row, since there is only one empty square left, we know that it must be either 4 or 6 because those are the only remaining numbers in this row. If it were a 6, then the third column would have to contain a 1 (as its other possibilities are 7 and 8). However, since the second and fourth rows already have a 1 each, there is no way for the third column to contain a 1. Therefore, let's place a 4 in the first row (|1| |5| | | | |8| |)\n\n7. Now we can see that the third row must contain a 1, and since it cannot be placed in the second or fourth columns, it can only go to the third column (8|3|4|6|7|_|9|_|_).\n\n8. We have now filled in 8 clues without repetition in each row, column, and box. Let's proceed with the remaining numbers:\n\nIn the second row and third column, since it shares the box with a 2 and cannot be 4 or 6 (as they are already used in this row), let's put a 3 there (| |_|5| | | | |8| |).\n\nSince we now know that the second row has both a 2 and a 3, it means that the third column must contain a 5 because it cannot have a 1 or 6 (those numbers are already used in this box). Let's put it there:\n( 1 |_| 5 | | | | | 8 | | )\n\nIn the fifth row, since both the first and second columns contain a 9, the third column must have a 7 because it cannot contain a 6 (since it is used in the sixth row). Also, if the fourth column contained a 1 or 3, then the second row would already be completed with repetition in its first and second columns. So let's put a 7 there:\n( |2| | |9|7|6|4|1| )\n\nIn the second row, since we now know that the third column contains a 5, it means that the fourth column can only have a 3 because a 2 would violate the box rule (since it already has a 3 in the second row). So let's put it there:\n( | |_|_| 3 | | | |6|4)\n\nNow we have filled in all but one number in the sixth column. Since it shares a box with a 2, it cannot be a 1 (since that would violate the row rule). And since it cannot be 8 due to the presence of a 3 in the same row, let's put a 5 there:\n( |2| _|_|3|5|_|4)\n\nAt this point, we can see that the third column must contain a 6 because it is the only remaining number for that column. Since the fifth row already has a 6 in the first column, let's place a 6 in the fourth column (8|3|4|_|7|_|9|1)\n\nNow we know that the third row cannot have a 1 or 3 because those numbers are already used in this box. Since it shares a box with a 6, it must contain an 8 (as there is no other remaining possibility). So let's place an 8 in the third row:\n(8|_|4|6|7|_|9|1)\n\nNow we can see that the first column must contain a 9 because it cannot be a 5 or 7 (since they are used in the second and sixth rows). Since the fourth row already has a 9 in the third column, let's place a 9 in the first column:\n(9|1|_| | | |_|8|_)\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second row must contain a 4 because it cannot have a 2 or 5 (since those numbers are already used in this box). Since there is no other remaining possibility for the sixth column, let's place a 4 there:\n( |_|_|_|3|5|4|1)\n\nNow we can see that the fourth row must contain a 7 because it cannot have a 6 or 9 (since they are already used in this box). Since there is no other remaining possibility for the fifth column, let's place a 7 there:\n(2|_|_|4|_|8|3|_)\n\nNow we can see that the third row must contain a 5 because it cannot have a 1 or 6 (since those numbers are already used in this box).

This test aims to assess participants' automatic or unconscious responses towards gender stereotypes.\n\nMaterials required: Computer with IAT software, keyboard (preferably labeled), stimuli images, and instruction manual.\n\nSteps:\n1. Introduction - Explain the purpose of the test and assure anonymity.\n2. Practice - Familiarize participants with the task by presenting four categories: Male (M), Female (F), Sport (S), and Nurturing (N). Participants are instructed to quickly categorize these images based on the assigned keys.\n3. Block 1 - Combine male names, sports, and male images; female names, nurturing activities, and female images in one category. Assign 'f' for females, 's' for sports, 'n' for nurturing, and '.' for neutral (no-response) as keys.\n4. Block 2 - Reverse the associations from Block 1; combine male names, nurturing activities, and female images; female names, sports, and male images in one category. Keep the same keys as in Block 1.\n5. Evaluation - Present random combinations of male and female names, sports, and nurturing activities; participants will respond by pressing 'f' for females, 's' for sports, 'n' for nurturing, or '.' for neutral.\n6. Repeat blocks 3 and 4 in alternation three times each.\n7. Recording - Record the reaction times for each key press during the evaluation block.\n8. Analysis - Analyze the results by calculating the difference between reaction times when responding to female-related stimuli with 'f' (F-f latency) and male-related stimuli with 'm' (M-f latency), as well as the reverse (F-m latency and M-m latency).\n\nTable for recording results:\n\n| Participant | Block   | Stimulus | Response | Reaction Time |\n|------------|--------|---------|----------|--------------|\n| P1         | Practice| Male    | f         | x            |\n| P1         | Practice| Female  | s         | y            |\n| ...       |        | ...     | ...       | ...          |\n| P1         | Evaluation | Female (F)   | F         | a           |\n| P1         | Evaluation | Male (M)      | f         | b           |\n...\n\nHypothetical Test Results:\n\n| Participant | Block 1 | Block 2 | Evaluation  | F-f Latency  | M-f Latency  |\n|------------|--------|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|\n| P1         | 490    | 510    | 485, 478, 502, ... | 5          | -3          |\n| P2         | 620    | 600    | 590, 595, 605, ... | 10          | -20         |\n| P3         | 540    | 500    | 530, 535, 548, ... | 0           | 0           |\n\nAnalysis:\n- A larger F-f latency compared to M-f latency indicates a stronger association between females and the feminine category. The opposite result (M-f > F-f) suggests a stronger association between males and the masculine category.\n- In our hypothetical results, participants P1 and P3 showed no implicit bias, as their reaction times were similar for both male and female associations. Participant P2 demonstrated an implicit bias in favor of gender stereotypes, taking longer to respond to feminine stimuli than masculine ones.\n\nConclusions: The GS-IAT provides insight into participants' automatic associations between gender and occupation. The test can help researchers understand the prevalence and strength of gender stereotypes within a population and their implications on attitudes towards genders and careers.", "eval": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true]}

The offspring will inherit one allele from each parent for both traits.\n\nNow, let's analyze the genotypic ratios:\n\n- AAbb: This combination corresponds to the phenotype AA (dominant trait expressed in both cases) and BB (recessive trait not expressed since B is dominant over b). Since this combination doesn't involve any recessive allele from parent A, it won't occur.\n\n- AaBb: This is the genotype of individual A, so one parent contributes an AaBb genotype, and the other parent can contribute either AAbb or aabb. Since both parents have at least one dominant allele (either A or B), all offspring will express the dominant traits for both characteristics. The probability that this combination occurs is 1 (since one parent has this genotype).\n\n- AaBB: This genotype corresponds to the phenotype AA and bb, where the dominant trait (A) is expressed in both cases, but the recessive trait (bb) is hidden since B is dominant over b. Parent B contributes this allele combination, while parent A can contribute either AA or aa. The probability of this combination occurring is 2 (since there are two possible ways for parent A to contribute alleles).\n\n- aaBB: This genotype corresponds to the phenotype BB, where neither the dominant nor the recessive traits of character 1 are expressed.

The probability of this combination occurring is also 2 (since there are two possible ways for parent A to contribute alleles).\n\nNow let's summarize the results:\n\nGenotypic ratios: AaBb (1), AaBB (2), aaBB (2)\n\nPhenotypic ratios: AA_dominant_trait_for_both, AA_dominant_trait_for_one_and_recessive_for_the_other, BB_only_dominant_trait_expressed (3:1:2)", "eval": [true, false, false, true, false, true, false]}

This research proposal aims to investigate the role of AI in enhancing healthcare outcomes, focusing on the development of predictive models for personalized care.\n\nBackground\n\nAI applications in healthcare span from image analysis for disease detection to drug discovery and patient management. Predictive modeling using AI algorithms can help anticipate health risks, tailor treatment plans, and monitor patient progress (Taha et al., 2019). However, current research primarily focuses on specific diseases or patient groups, limiting the applicability of these models in real-world settings (Guest et al., 2020).\n\nRelated Work\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of AI predictive models for diabetes management (Xiao et al., 2019), mental health care (Liu et al., 2020), and cancer diagnosis (Mortada et al., 2019). These models are built on large datasets, incorporating various demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Despite their promising results, these studies lack a comprehensive approach that considers multiple health conditions simultaneously, leading to incomplete patient profiles and less personalized care (Guest et al., 2020).\n\nLimitations of Prior Work\n\nThe limitations of prior work include: (1) the use of limited datasets, (2) a focus on specific diseases rather than overall health management, (3) neglecting the interaction between multiple health conditions, and (4) a lack of real-world applicability due to overfitting or insufficient validation (Guest et al., 2020).\n\nResearch Objectives\n\nThe objectives of this research are threefold: (1) to develop an AI predictive model that considers multiple health conditions simultaneously, (2) to evaluate the model's performance in predicting health risks and treatment responses, and (3) to assess the model's practical applicability in real-world healthcare settings.\n\nProposed Methods\n\nOur proposed methods involve: (1) collecting extensive datasets from various sources, including electronic health records, wearable devices, and self-reported health data, (2) applying advanced machine learning algorithms for feature selection and model development, ensuring the model's ability to adapt to new data, (3) validating the model on diverse patient populations and real-world scenarios, and (4) collaborating with healthcare providers to assess the model's practicality and potential impact on patient care.\n\nDistinctions from Previous Work\n\nOur approach distinguishes itself from previous work by: (1) considering multiple health conditions simultaneously rather than focusing on a single disease or condition, (2) using diverse datasets that incorporate various demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors, (3) employing advanced machine learning algorithms for model development to ensure adaptability and performance, and (4) collaborating with healthcare providers to evaluate the model's practical applicability and potential impact on patient care.\n\nAvoiding Drawbacks\n\nTo address the limitations of previous work, our research aims to: (1) use large and diverse datasets that cover various health conditions, (2) develop a comprehensive predictive model that considers multiple health conditions simultaneously, (3) employ advanced machine learning techniques to ensure adaptability to new data, and (4) validate the model on diverse patient populations and real-world scenarios.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis research aims to explore the role of AI in enhancing healthcare outcomes by developing a predictive model for personalized care. By addressing the limitations of previous work, we aim to create an innovative, practical, and comprehensive solution that could significantly impact healthcare practices.\n\nReferences:\n\nGuest, A., Ding, J., & Lohrke, J.

{"id": "82", "input": "Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim.

Binary 1100100010110110010110 to decimal value:\nSince the binary number is already in groups of four bits (starting from the right), we can directly convert each group to its hexadecimal representation using the table provided (remember that the hexadecimal place values are powers of 16):\n- 1, 1, 0, 0 -> B (base 16)\n- 0, 0, 1, 0 -> 4\n- 1, 1, 1, 0 -> E\n- 0, 1, 0, 1 -> 5\n- 1, 1, 0, 1 -> B (base 16)\n- 0, 1, 1, 0 -> 6\n\nNow, convert each hex digit to its decimal value:\n- B -> 11 (since it's a letter, not a number)\n- 4 -> 4\n- E -> 14 (since it's a letter, not a number)\n- 5 -> 5\n- B -> 11 (since it's a letter, not a number)\n- 6 -> 6\n\nFinally, calculate the decimal value by multiplying each hex digit by its place value and summing up:\nDecimal = (11 * 16\u00b3) + (4 * 16\u00b2) + (14 * 16\u00b9) + (5 * 16\u2070) + (11 * 1) + (6)\n       = (327680) + (64) + (2048) + (5) + (11) + (6)\n       = 328445\n\nE. Decimal value 983445 to hexadecimal:\nFirst, convert the decimal number into binary representation (since we can only work with base 2 or larger in this case):\nBinary(983445) = 1000010100111000101111\nNow, group the binary digits into sets of four starting from the right (least significant bits):\n- 1, 0, 0, 0 -> 4 (from the table)\n- 0, 0, 1, 1 -> 5\n- 0, 1, 0, 1 -> 5\n- 0, 1, 1, 1 -> B (from the table)\n- 0, 1, 1, 0 -> 6\n- 1, 0, 0, 1 -> 5\n- 0, 0, 1, 0 -> 2 (from the table)\n- 1, 1, 0, 0 -> E (from the table)\n\nCombine these hex digits in reverse order to get the final hexadecimal representation:\n5B0EF5562 (or 0x5B0EF5562)\n\nF. Decimal value 1789 to binary value:\nFirst, convert the decimal number into a quinary representation by performing successive division by 5 and keeping the remainders (also known as \"quotoient\"):\nQuinary(1789) = 3421 (2 zeros in the end since the remainder is always between 0 and 4, which can be represented by a single digit in quinary):\n- Quotient(1789/5) = 357\n- Remainder(1789 % 5) = 4 (write this as the first digit in our quinary representation)\n- Quotient(357/5) = 71\n- Remainder(357 % 5) = 2\n- Quotient(71/5) = 14\n- Remainder(71 % 5) = 4 (write this as the second digit in our quinary representation)\n- Quotient(14/5) = 2\n- Remainder(14 % 5) = 4 (write this as the third digit in our quinary representation)\nNow, convert the quinary number to binary by looking up its corresponding binary value:\n- 4 -> 001\n- 2 -> 000\n- 4 -> 001\n- 4 -> 001\n\nNow, reverse the order of the binary groups and pad any missing bits with zeros on the left side to get a representation with exactly 8 digits:\n00100010 (padded from 421 in quinary)\nFinally, convert this binary number to its base-10 decimal value:\nDecimal(00100010) = 2\u00b2 + 0 * 2\u00b9 + 0 * 2\u2070 + 0 * 2\u207b\u00b9 + 0 * 2\u207b\u00b2 + 0 * 2\u207b\u00b3 + 0 * 2\u207b\u2074 + 10 * 2\u207b\u2075 = 10 (since we only have a single non-zero digit, this means that the other bits were all zero)\nHowever, we made an error during the quinary representation conversion step. The correct decimal-to-quinary conversion should be:\nQuinary(1789) = 342 (without the zeros at the end):\n- Quotient(1789/5) = 357\n- Remainder(1789 % 5) = 4 (write this as the first digit in our quinary representation)\n- Quotient(357/5) = 71\n- Remainder(357 % 5) = 1\n- Quotient(71/5) = 14\n- Remainder(71 % 5) = 4 (write this as the second digit in our quinary representation)\n- Quotient(14/5) = 2\n- Remainder(14 % 5) = 4 (write this as the third digit in our quinary representation)\nNow, convert the quinary number to binary by looking up its corresponding binary value:\n- 4 -> 001\n- 1 -> 001\n- 4 -> 001\n- 4 -> 001\n\nNow, reverse the order of the binary groups and pad any missing bits with zeros on the left side to get a representation with exactly 8 digits:\n00100100 (padded from 214 in quinary)\nFinally, convert this binary number to its base-10 decimal value:\nDecimal(00100100) = 2\u00b2 + 0 * 2\u00b9 + 1 * 2\u2070 + 0 * 2\u207b\u00b9 + 0 * 2\u207b\u00b2 + 0 * 2\u207b\u00b3 + 1 * 2\u207b\u2074 + 0 * 2\u207b\u2075 = 8 + 4 = 12\nSo, the correct binary representation of 1789 is 00100100 (without the zeros at the end).", "eval": [true, false, false, false, false, false]}
