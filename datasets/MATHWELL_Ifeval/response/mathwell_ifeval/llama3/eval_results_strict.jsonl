This means that if he has x rushing yards, then he has x + 200 passing yards. Since we know he has 400 passing yards, we can set up an equation:\n\nx + 200 = 400\n\nSubtracting 200 from both sides gives us:\n\nx = 200\n\nSo, Patrick Mahomes has 200 rushing yards.\n\n**Section 3: Conclusion**\n\nWith the solution to the mystery in hand, we can confidently say that Patrick Mahomes has indeed accumulated 200 rushing yards.
