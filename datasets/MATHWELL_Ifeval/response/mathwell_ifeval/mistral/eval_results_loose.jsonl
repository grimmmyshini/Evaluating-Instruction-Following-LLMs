This conversion factor is crucial for our calculation.\n\nNow, we have the given height of Captain Marvel, which is 1.83 m. To find out how tall she is in feet, we multiply her height by the conversion factor we derived earlier:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\text{{Height in Feet}} = \\text{{Height in Meters}} \\times \\text{{Conversion Factor}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nUsing this equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    & \\text{{Height in Feet}} = \\text{{1.83 m}} \\times \\text{{3.281 ft/m}} \\\\\n                   &\\approx 5\\text{{.839 ft}}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, using the conversion factor of 3.281 ft/m and applying it to Captain Marvel's height of 1.83 m gives us an approximate height of 5 feet and 8.39 inches for Captain Marvel in feet and inches (since we can't represent decimal feet in our standard measuring system).\n\nIn conclusion, with the help of conversion factors and a bit of math, we can find out that Captain Marvel stands approximately 5 feet and 8.39 inches tall!"}

Since there are fewer chocolate scoops than either vanilla or strawberry, the minimum value indicates that at least some people have more than one type of ice cream (which contradicts our assumption in Section 1 but helps to illustrate the solution).
