Please provide the necessary details so that I can assist you effectively.\"\n\n**Paragraph 2**\n\nPurchase records for a particular product over a period of time indicate a linear relationship between the quantity sold and the price per unit. This implies that the total cost of the product will increase at a constant rate as the price per unit rises. The mathematical equation representing this relationship can be expressed as:\n\n$$\\boxed{Total Cost = Quantity \\times Price per Unit + Fixed Cost}$$\n\n**Paragraph 3**\n\nWhere Fixed Cost represents the initial investment or expenses that remain constant regardless of the quantity sold. The fixed cost remains the same, regardless of the quantity of the product purchased.\n\n**Paragraph 4**\n\nHere is a Python function named func5 that calculates the total cost of a product based on the quantity sold, price per unit, and fixed cost:\n\n```python\ndef func5(quantity, price, fixed_cost):\n    return quantity * price + fixed_cost\n```\n\nThis function takes three arguments: quantity, price per unit, and fixed cost. It returns the total cost of the product."}
