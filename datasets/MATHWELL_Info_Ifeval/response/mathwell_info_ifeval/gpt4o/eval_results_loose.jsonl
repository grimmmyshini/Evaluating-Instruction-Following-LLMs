Calculate the number of punches in the first 5 minutes.\n2. Add the additional 200 punches.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. In the first 5 minutes, she punches 100 times per minute. So, for 5 minutes:\n   \\( 100 \\text{ punches/minute} \\times 5 \\text{ minutes} = 500 \\text{ punches} \\)\n\n2. Add the additional 200 punches:\n   \\( 500 \\text{ punches} + 200 \\text{ punches} = 700 \\text{ punches} \\)\n\nTherefore, Captain Marvel has punched a total of 700 times.\n\nHere is the implementation of a Python function named `func41` that calculates the total number of punches:\n\n```python\ndef func41():\n    punches_per_minute = 100\n    minutes = 5\n    additional_punches = 200\n\n    total_punches = (punches_per_minute * minutes) + additional_punches\n    return total_punches\n\n# Example usage\nresult = func41()\nprint(result)  # Output: 700\n```\n\nThe equation that solves this problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100 \\times 5 + 200}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of punches is 700.\""}
