", "response": "### Finding the Median\n\nMedian is the middle value of a dataset when assorted in numerical order. To find the median in the set of data 23, 13, 18, 29, 32, 25, we first need to sort them in ascending order: 13, 18, 23, 25, 29, 32.\n\n***\n\nThere are 6 values in the dataset, an even number. In such a case, the median is the average of the two middle values. The two middle values in the dataset are 23 and 25.\n\n***\n\nTherefore, the median of the given dataset is the average of 23 and 25: (23 + 25) / 2 = 24.\n\n***\n\nThe median of the set of data 23, 13, 18, 29, 32, 25 is **24**.\n\n***\n\nThe median divides the dataset into two equal halves, with half of the values being less than 24 and the other half being greater than or equal to 24."}
