This operation is often encountered in basic arithmetic or simple algebraic expressions.\n\nFor instance, if you're solving a problem related to counting objects, such as counting the total number of tiles in two separate rooms (one with 64 and another with 8), you might use this expression: \"To find the total number of tiles, add the tiles in both rooms: 64 + 8 = 72.\"\n\nIn programming or computational science, it represents a calculation where you're adding two numbers, such as the steps to find an answer in a computer game, calculating the cost of items for online shopping, or even analyzing data sets.\n\nAdditionally, this expression could be part of a more complex equation, such as finding the area of a rectangle when only the length (64) and width (8) are known: \"To find the area of the rectangle, multiply the length by the width and then add 2 times the length with the width (because it's a square): Area = (length * width) + (2 * length * width) = 64 * 8 + 2 * 64 * 8 = 512 + 512 = 1024.\"\n\nFinally, it can be utilized in everyday situations requiring simple addition. For example, when you're budgeting for groceries: \"If the price of one kilo of rice is 64 dollars and a kilo of wheat is 8 dollars, what will it cost to buy both: Cost = 64 + 8 = 72 dollars.\"\n\nIn summary, the expression \"64 + 8\" can be used in various situations where simple addition is required for solving problems related to counting objects, calculating costs, or even more complex mathematical equations."}

{"follow_all_instructions": true, "follow_instruction_list": [true], "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "prompt": "A certain map uses a scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles. How many miles are represented by 5 inches on this map?  Your response should contain at least 15 sentences.", "response": " To find the number of miles represented by 5 inches on the given map, we will use the scale provided: 1 inch equals 25 miles. Here's how to approach the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let us remember that the scale is a ratio that shows the proportion between the distance on the map and the actual distance on the ground. In this case, the scale ratio is 1:25 (or 1/25).\n\n2. We are given that 5 inches on the map represent an unknown number of miles. To find this value, we will make use of the scale ratio and the known values of 1 inch equals 25 miles and 5 inches in total.\n\n3. Set up a proportion equation using the known ratio and the corresponding distances:\n\n   - Scale ratio (map inches / actual miles) = 1/25\n\n4. In this case, we know that 5 inches is equal to x number of miles. We can write another proportion equation:\n\n   - Scale ratio (map inches / actual miles) = 5/x\n\n5. Since the two ratios are equal, we can now set them equal to each other and solve for x:\n\n   - 1/25 = 5/x\n\n6. Cross-multiply to simplify the equation:\n\n   - 25 * 5 = x * 1\n\n7. Simplify the equation:\n\n   - 125 = x\n\n8. So, 125 miles are represented by 5 inches on this map according to the given scale.\n\n9. It's important to note that any distances on a map can only be measured in whole numbers because a map represents an approximation of reality, and there is no such thing as a fraction or decimal-sized distance in the real world.\n\n10. The number 125 miles may seem large for just 5 inches, but keep in mind that this scale was chosen to represent distances accurately at a large geographical level. If we wanted a more detailed map with smaller scales (e.g., 1 inch equals 1 mile or even 1 inch equals 0.5 miles), the distances on the map would be correspondingly smaller.\n\n11. To verify our answer, we can check if multiplying 5 inches by 25 miles/inch gives us our original distance in miles:\n\n   - 5 * 25 = 125 (verifying that our calculated distance is correct)\n\n12. In practical terms, this means that the map covers an area where distances are about 25 times greater than they appear on the map. This can help us quickly visualize and compare large geographical areas without having to measure physical distances directly.\n\n13. For example, if we see a distance of 8 inches on the map, it represents approximately 200 miles in reality. This is useful for planning routes, understanding landmarks' relative positions, and getting an overall sense of size and location.\n\n14. Keep in mind that not all maps use the same scale. Some may have different scales depending on the area they represent (e.g., city maps often use a smaller scale than regional or country maps). Always check the map legend for the specific scale being used before making assumptions about distances.\n\n15. In summary, to find the number of miles represented by 5 inches on this map with a scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles, we can set up and solve a proportion equation. The result shows that 125 miles are represented by 5 inches on this particular map."}
