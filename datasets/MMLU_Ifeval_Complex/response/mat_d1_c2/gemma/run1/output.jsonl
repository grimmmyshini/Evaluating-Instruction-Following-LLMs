{"prompt": "A certain map uses a scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles. How many miles are represented by 5 inches on this map?  Your response should contain at least 15 sentences. Finish your response with this exact phrase \"Any other questions?\". No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "Given that 1 inch on the map represents 25 miles in real life, we can determine that the distance represented by 5 inches on the map is 5 times the distance represented by 1 inch.\n\nTo find the actual distance represented by 5 inches, we can multiply the distance represented by 1 inch (25 miles) by 5.\n\nDistance represented by 5 inches = 25 miles/inch * 5 inches = 125 miles\n\nTherefore, 5 inches on the map represents **125 miles** in real life.\n\nAny other questions?"}
