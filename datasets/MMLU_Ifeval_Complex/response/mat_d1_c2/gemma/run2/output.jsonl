{"prompt": "Find the number that makes the statement 48 over 88 = ? over 11 true.  Your response must have 5 sections. Mark the beginning of each section with SECTION X, such as:\nSECTION 1\n[content of section 1]\nSECTION 2\n[content of section 2] Your response should contain at least 6 sentences.", "response": "## SECTION 1\nThe statement can be rewritten as: 48/88 = x/11. This means that 48 is the numerator and 88 is the denominator on the left side of the equation, while x is the numerator and 11 is the denominator on the right side.\n\n\n## SECTION 2\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply the equation: 48 * 11 = 88 * x.\n\n\n## SECTION 3\nThis simplifies to: 528 = 88x.\n\n\n## SECTION 4\nTo isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 88: x = 528 / 88.\n\n\n## SECTION 5\nTherefore, 528 over 88 equals **6** over 11."}

{"prompt": "A certain map uses a scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles. How many miles are represented by 5 inches on this map?  Your response should contain at least 15 sentences. Finish your response with this exact phrase \"Any other questions?\". No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "Given that 1 inch on the map represents 25 miles in real life, we can determine the distance represented by 5 inches on the map.\n\nTo find the distance in miles represented by 5 inches, we can follow a simple proportion:\n\n1 inch / 25 miles = 5 inches / x miles\n\nCross-multiplying this equation, we get:\n\n1 inch * x miles = 5 inches * 25 miles\n\nSimplifying this equation, we find:\n\nx = (5 inches * 25 miles) / 1 inch\n\nx = 125 miles\n\nTherefore, 5 inches on this map represents 125 miles in real life.\n\nAny other questions?"}
