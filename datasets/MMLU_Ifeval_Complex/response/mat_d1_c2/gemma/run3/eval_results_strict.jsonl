To determine how many miles are represented by 5 inches on such a map, we can follow a straightforward mathematical process.\n\nFirst, we need to establish the ratio between the distance on the map (in inches) and the distance in the real world (in miles). The given scale tells us that 1 inch on the map equals 25 miles. This can be expressed as:\n\n1 inch (map) : 25 miles (reality)\n\nNext, we can substitute the distance on the map (5 inches) into the ratio:\n\n5 inches (map) : x miles (reality)\n\nTo find the value of x, we can cross-multiply the ratio:\n\n1 inch * x miles = 5 inches * 25 miles\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = (5 inches * 25 miles) / 1 inch = 125 miles\n\nTherefore, 5 inches on the map represent 125 miles in the real world.\n\nAny other questions?"}
