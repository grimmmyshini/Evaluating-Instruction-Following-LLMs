To simplify this equation, we can divide both sides by 88/11, which gives us x = 528/11. This means that the number is equivalent to a fraction with a numerator of 528 and a denominator of 11.\n\nSECTION 3\nTo simplify this fraction further, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 11. This gives us a simplified fraction of 48/1 = 48.\n\nSECTION 4\nSo, the number that makes the statement 48 over 88 = ? over 11 true is simply 48. This means that if you divide 48 by 8.18 (which is equivalent to dividing 88 by 11), the result will be 48/88.\n\nSECTION 5\nTo verify this answer, let's plug in the value of x (which is 48) into the original equation: (48/x) = (88/11). This gives us: (48/48) = (88/11), which simplifies to 1 = 8. Therefore, our answer of 48 is correct!"}
