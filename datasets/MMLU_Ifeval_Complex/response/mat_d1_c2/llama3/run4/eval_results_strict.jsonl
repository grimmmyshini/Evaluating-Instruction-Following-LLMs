The notation \"48 over 88\" is a fraction, which represents the division of 48 by 88. Similarly, \"? over 11\" is also a fraction that represents the division of ? by 11.\n\nSECTION 2: Converting the Fractions\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert the fractions into equivalent decimals or percentages. The decimal form of the first fraction (48/88) can be found by dividing 48 by 88:\n\n48 \u00f7 88 = 0.545\n\nSimilarly, the decimal form of the second fraction (? /11) would depend on what number ? is.
