To make this statement true, we need to find a value for \"?\" that satisfies the equation.\n\n**SECTION 2: Simplifying the Fractions**\nBefore we start searching for the value of \"?\", let's simplify both fractions by dividing their numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 48 and 88 is 8, so we can simplify these two fractions as follows:\n\n48 \u00f7 8 = 6\n88 \u00f7 8 = 11\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 6/11.\n\n**SECTION 3: Finding the Equivalent Fraction**\nNow that both fractions are in their simplest form, let's try to find a value for \"?\" such that the equation 6/11 = ?/11 holds true. We know that the numerator and denominator of this second fraction need to be multiplied by some number to equal 6.\n\nLet's assume we multiply the numerator and denominator of ?/11 by x. Then, our new equation becomes:\n\n(??)/11 = 6\n\nSince both fractions have a denominator of 11, let's focus on finding the value of \"??\". We know that:\n\n?? = 6 \u00d7 11 = 66\n\nNow we need to find a value for \"?\" such that when we multiply it by x, we get 66. Let's set up an equation:\n\n? \u00d7 x = 66\n\n**SECTION 4: Solving the Equation**\nTo solve this equation, we can divide both sides by x, which gives us:\n\n? = 66 \u00f7 x\n\nSince we don't know the value of x yet, let's just represent it as some arbitrary number. Then, our final equation becomes:\n\n? = 66/x\n\n**SECTION 5: Conclusion**\nThe value of \"?\" that makes the statement \"48 over 88 = ? over 11\" true is equal to 66/x. To find a specific numerical value for \"?\", we need to know the value of x or solve the equation 6/11 = ?/11, which involves finding the correct value of x."}
