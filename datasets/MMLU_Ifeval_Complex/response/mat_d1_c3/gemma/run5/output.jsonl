This signifies that for every unit of 0.06 present, there are 36 units of 2.16 to be found.\n\nThe process of division simply involves breaking down the larger number into smaller parts that are divisible by the smaller number. In this case, 2.16 is comfortably divisible by 0.06, resulting in a clean and exact quotient of 36.\n\nPie charts are often used to visually represent quotients, with the larger number being divided into slices proportional to the smaller number. In this scenario, a pie chart would demonstrate that 36 slices of 0.06 fit perfectly into a circle representing 2.16."}
