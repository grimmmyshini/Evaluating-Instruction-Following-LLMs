This fraction demonstrates that there are 875 portions out of a total of 1000 equal parts.\n\nSECTION 3\nReducing the Fraction to Simplest Form\nTo simplify 875/1000 we need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 875 and 1000. The GCD of 875 and 1000 is 125. We simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by this GCD:\n875 \u00f7 125 = 7\n1000 \u00f7 125 = 8\nSo 875/1000 simplifies to 7/8.\n\nSECTION 4\nConstructing the Mixed Number\nWe can now combine the whole number from the original decimal 5 with the simplified fraction 7/8.

We can use cross-multiplication, which involves multiplying the denominator of one fraction by the numerator of the other fraction. Here, the fractions are 48/88 and ?/11.\n\nSECTION 2\nWe set up the cross multiplication: 48 * 11 = 88 * ?. This step will help us establish the equation to find the unknown variable, represented here as ?.\n\nSECTION 3\nPerforming the calculation on the left side of the equation, 48 multiplied by 11 equals 528. The equation now looks like 528 = 88 * ?.\n\nSECTION 4\nTo isolate the unknown variable, we divide both sides of the equation by 88. So, it simplifies to ? = 528 / 88. Calculating this division gives us 6. Therefore, the missing number in the proportion is 6.\n\nSECTION 5\nSubstituting the value back into the proportion to check our work, we get 48/88 = 6/11. Simplifying 48/88 results in approximately 0.545 and likewise, simplifying 6/11 also gives approximately 0.545, confirming our solution is correct. \n\nAny other questions?"}

No other words should follow this phrase. Along with providing an answer to the question, give the mathematical equation that solves this problem. Wrap this (and only this) equation in a box. Use Latex style formatting to format the math equation.", "response": "To understand how to solve this problem, we should start by comprehending what a map scale means. A map scale provides a ratio of the distance on the map to the actual distance on the ground. For this particular map, the scale is given as 1 inch equals 25 miles. This tells us that every inch on the map corresponds to a real-world distance of 25 miles.\n\nGiven this scale, if you measure a distance on the map, you can calculate the actual distance that measurement represents by using the scale as a conversion factor. It allows for a straightforward multiplication to convert map measurements into actual distances.\n\nThe problem here asks how many miles are represented by 5 inches on this map. To solve this, we need to apply the map scale as our conversion factor. We already know the following:\n- 1 inch on the map equals 25 miles in reality.\n\nTo find out how many miles 5 inches represent, we multiply the number of inches by the number of miles that each inch represents. This is a basic arithmetic problem where you multiply the value associated with one unit (in this case, the inch) by the number of units (in this case, 5 inches).\n\nThe mathematical formula to calculate this is simple: you take the number of inches on the map and multiply it by the number of miles each inch represents. Here\u2019s how that looks in a math equation:\n\\[\n\\boxed{Miles = Inches \\times \\text{Miles per Inch}}\n\\]\n\nApplying this to the specific values given in the problem, we substitute 'In inches' with 5 (since we are considering 5 inches), and 'Miles per Inch' with 25 (as given by the map scale):\n\\[\n\\boxed{Miles = 5 \\times 25}\n\\]\n\nNow, performing the multiplication:\n- 5 inches times 25 miles per inch gives us 125 miles.\n\nThus, 5 inches on the map represents 125 miles in the real world.\n\nUnderstanding this conversion is quite practical not just in academic exercises but also in real-life scenarios, such as planning trips and estimating travel times based on distances shown on maps.\n\nIt's essential to remember that this kind of multiplication, where a unit from the map is multiplied by a real-world distance, is a direct application of the concept of ratios and proportions. This demonstrates not just a mathematical skill but also an understanding of how these mathematical concepts are used in everyday life scenarios.\n\nTo recap, by following the simple step of multiplying the number of inches by the map's scale, you effortlessly convert map measurements into real distances. This application is crucial in fields like geography, urban planning, and even in leisure activities like hiking or driving. \n\nAny other questions?"}
