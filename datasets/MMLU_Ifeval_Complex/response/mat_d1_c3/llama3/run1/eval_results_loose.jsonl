To find the distance represented by 5 inches, we need to multiply the length of the measurement (in inches) by the scale factor.\n\nLet's use the equation:\n\n**$$\\boxed{\\text{Distance} = \\text{Length} \\times \\frac{\\text{Scale}}{1}}$$**\n\nIn this case, the length is 5 inches, and the scale is 25 miles per inch.
