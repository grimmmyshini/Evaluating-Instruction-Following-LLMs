We don't know how much markers and paper will cost yet.\n\n***\n\n\n**Step 2:** The total cost of the markers and paper is more than $14.\n\nSo, the cost of markers and paper (M + P) must be at least $15 ($14 plus one more dollar). We can represent this as an inequality: M + P \u2265 15.\n\n***\n\n\n**Step 3:** Since George has only $23 in total to spend, we need to make sure that the money left over after buying markers and paper doesn't exceed the amount he has. This means that the cost of glue (p) must be less than or equal to the remaining money ($23 minus M + P). We can represent this as another inequality: 23 - (M + P) \u2265 p.\n\nNow, we need to simplify this inequality to get an expression in terms of p only. We'll do that by subtracting M + P from both sides:\n\n23 - M - P \u2265 p\n- M - P \u2265 p\n\nThen, we can add M + P to both sides to get rid of the negative term:\n\n- (M + P) + M + P \u2265 p + M + P\n0 \u2265 p + 15\n\nFinally, we subtract 15 from both sides to isolate p:\n\np \u2264 8"}

No other words should follow this phrase. Along with providing an answer to the question, give the mathematical equation that solves this problem. Wrap this (and only this) equation in a box. Use Latex style formatting to format the math equation.", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to recognize that since 1 inch on the map represents 25 miles, we can set up a proportion between the inches and the miles. This allows us to find the number of miles represented by a certain distance in inches.\n\nFor example, if the map uses a scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles, then 2 inches would represent 2 x 25 = 50 miles, and 3 inches would represent 3 x 25 = 75 miles. Similarly, we can use this proportion to find the number of miles represented by 5 inches on the map.\n\nTo do this, we set up a proportion between 1 inch and its corresponding distance in miles (25 miles), and then compare it with 5 inches and its corresponding distance in miles:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{5}{x}$$\n\nWhere $x$ is the number of miles represented by 5 inches.\n\nTo solve for $x$, we can cross-multiply, giving us:\n\n$$5 \\times 25 = x \\times 1$$\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$$125 = x$$\n\nSo, 5 inches on this map represents 125 miles. Any other questions?"}
