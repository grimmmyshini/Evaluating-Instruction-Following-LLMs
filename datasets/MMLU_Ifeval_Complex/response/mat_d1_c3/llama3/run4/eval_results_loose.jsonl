We can think of it as asking: \"If 1 inch represents 25 miles, how many miles does 5 inches represent?\"\n\nTo answer this question, we can set up a proportion using the given information:\n\n$$\\frac{1 \\text{ inch}}{25 \\text{ miles}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ inches}}{x \\text{ miles}}$$\n\nThis proportion is saying that the ratio of 1 inch to 25 miles is equal to the ratio of 5 inches to x miles.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by cross-multiplying:\n\n$$1 \\times x = 5 \\times 25$$\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n$$x = 5 \\times 25 = 125$$\n\nSo, according to our proportion, 5 inches on the map represents 125 miles.\n\nAny other questions?"}
