To do that, find a numerator such that when placed over 1 (as denominator), it equals or is slightly less than 5.875. Let's use 6 as the tentative numerator to get 6/1 = 6.

Next, we move on to the second power of the first factor, which is **121**, and multiply this by the second factor: **121 * 13 = 1573**. This also doesn't give the correct answer (143).\n3.

In this case, we won't be adding any zeroes since neither number contains them. Now that we have our numbers ready, let's divide as follows:\n\n(2.16) \u00f7 (0.06) = 35.3333...\n\nTo obtain a more readable result, we can round the decimal to two places after the decimal point for practical purposes.

The most common method is the traditional way of writing fractions horizontally: dividend over divisor. Here, I will present the result using that format, but please note that the fraction form can also be written as a mixed number if the quotient has a whole number part and a decimal part.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1. Write the division problem in standard notation: 5.04 (dividend) / 0.7 (divisor) = 5 2/3 + ____\n    Here, I'm converting 5.04 to a mixed number because it's easier to see the whole and fractional parts separately. The whole part of 5.04 is 5 (as 3 thirds is equal to approximately 1), and the remaining 0.04 can be seen as an additional fourth.\n\n2. Solve for the missing part:\n    Since we have 5 wholes and 4 fourths, the number of fourths left to distribute is 6 (because there are four quarters in one whole, so subtracting 4 from the total 10 parts leaves us with 6 fourths). At this point, each fourth represents 0.25, as we know that 1 fourth = 0.25. Therefore, to find out how many fourths 6 fourths is, multiply 6 by 0.25: 6 * 0.25 = **1.5**.\n\n3.
