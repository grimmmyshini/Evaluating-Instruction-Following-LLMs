Since 5 is already a whole number, the fractional part is simply 0.875. Therefore, 5.875 as a mixed number is **5 3/4**.\n\n**SECTION 2**\nTo write 5.875 as a fraction in simplest form, we first convert it to a fraction: 5 3/4. Now, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1 and 4 (the denominators of the numerator and denominator of the fraction). The GCD of 1 and 4 is 1, so neither number can be simplified further. Therefore, as a fraction in simplest form, 5.875 is **(5 3/4) = 5 3/4**.\n\n**SECTION 3**\nTo check our work, we can convert the mixed number back to a decimal: (5 + 0.25) = 5.25. Comparing this with the original decimal number, 5.875, we find that they are very close but not exactly equal. This indicates that our answer is an approximation and may not be the exact equivalent of 5.875 as a mixed number or fraction in simplest form.\n\n**SECTION 4**\nTo obtain the exact equivalent of 5.875, we would need to use a different mathematical operation, such as finding the repeating decimal expansion or converting 5.875 to a rationalized irrational form using square roots (since 5.875 is slightly more than half of the square root of 2).\n\n**SECTION 5**\nIn this exercise, our primary focus was on writing the given decimal number as a mixed number or fraction in simplest form. We found that 5.875 as a mixed number is **5 3/4**, and as a fraction in simplest form, it remains **(5 3/4)** because neither 5 nor 4 can be further simplified. The discrepancy between our approximation and the original decimal number demonstrates that we cannot obtain an exact equivalent for 5.875 using only mixed numbers or simple fractions without introducing decimals or irrational expressions."}

", "response": " **Step 1:** Let's first denote the cost of markers as m (for markers) and the cost of paper as p (for paper). We are given that George spends a total of $23 on art supplies, so we have the equation:\n\n**m + p + glue = 23** (1)\n\nWe know that the total cost of markers and paper is more than $14, so we can write this as an inequality:\n\n**m + p > 14** (2)\n\n**Step 2:** Now let's find out how much George can spend on glue. Since m + p > 14, any value for glue that satisfies **glue < 23 - (m + p)** will be valid, as it ensures that the total amount spent does not exceed $23.\n\nHowever, since we want to minimize the amount of glue George has to buy, we should find the maximum possible value for this expression. To do so, let's assume that m and p are both as large as possible under the inequality (2). In other words, let's assume that m = 14 and p = 0 (these values make the sum of markers and paper equal to exactly $14). Under these assumptions:\n\n**m + p < 14 + glue \u2264 23** (3)\n\nSolving this inequality for glue gives us:\n\n**glue > 8** (4)\n\n**Step 3:** Finally, we can summarize our answer. Since George can spend at most $23 on art supplies, and he must spend at least $8 on glue to meet his requirements, the inequality representing the dollar amount George can spend on glue is:\n\n**glue > 8**\n\nThis means that George can spend any amount of money on glue greater than $8, as long as he stays within the total budget of $23."}

Write down the numbers with the divisor below the dividend as shown:\n   ______ .04\n    \\    7\n\n2. Count how many times the divisor (0.7) can be subtracted from the dividend (5.04) without going under:\n\n    - First, subtract 0.7 from 5.04 giving us 4.34 remaining.\n    - Subtracting again gives us 3.67. We've used up 1 full copy of the divisor and have a remainder of 3.67.\n    - At this point, we can't subtract any more whole copies of our divisor (0.7) as it would go under the remaining value.\n\n3.

Similarly, find the reciprocal of 88: (1/88 = 0.011364) approximately.\n\nSECTION 3: Now that we have the reciprocals of both numbers, let's set up our new equation with the reciprocals: We want our new statement to be true, i.e., 0.020833 = ? over 11.\n\nSECTION 4: To solve for the unknown in our new equation, multiply both sides by 11 (the denominator): (0.020833 * 11) = ?. This simplifies to approximately 0.229167. Now we can find the integer value of the numerator: rounding up (since we are dealing with a fraction), the nearest smaller whole number is not appropriate, so the nearest larger whole number gives us our numerator: 2 (since 2 + 0.229167 > 0.23).\n\nSECTION 5: Finally, combine this information to formulate our answer as a fraction: The number that makes the statement 48 over 88 = ? over 11 true is approximately 2 over 11.

The proportion is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{ \\frac{1~inch}{25~miles} = \\frac{5~inches}{x~miles}}\n\nTo solve for x, we cross-multiply and simplify the equation:\n\n$1 * x = 5 * 25$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\n$x = (5 * 25)$\n\nFurther simplification yields:\n\n$x = 125$\n\nSo, 5 inches on this map represent 125 miles.\n\nIn other words, the number of miles represented by 5 inches is 125 miles.\n\nNow, let's put this into context.
