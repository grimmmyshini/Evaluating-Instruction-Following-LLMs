Do not include keywords ['guidance', 'option'] in the response.", "response": " Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many points Jaden could have scored.\n\nFirstly, we know that Jaden scored less than 45 points in the game. This means his score can be any number from 1 to 44 (inclusive) because any number greater than 45 does not meet the criteria.\n\nSecondly, we understand that Jaden's score must be a multiple of 7. A multiple of 7 is any integer that is divisible by 7 without leaving a remainder when divided by 7.\n\nTo find all the multiples of 7 within the given range (1 to 44), we can create a sequence starting with 0 times 7, which equals 0, and then incrementing by 7 each time:\n\n0 + 7 = 7 (first multiple)\n7 + 7 = 14 (second multiple)\n14 + 7 = 21 (third multiple)\n21 + 7 = 28 (fourth multiple)\nContinuing this way, the sequence will contain 36 as the sixth multiple, but it falls outside our given range of 1 to 44. Therefore, we only need to consider the first five multiples: 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35.\n\nSince Jaden scored less than 45 points in the game and his score is a multiple of 7, the possible scores he could have made are 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35. However, it's worth noting that 14, 21, and 35 are not less than 45, so Jaden didn't score these numbers. Thus, the only possibility within our given criteria is that Jaden scored 7 points in the game.\n\nTo summarize, we found the possible scores for Jaden by determining all multiples of 7 under 45 and examining whether each score was less than 45:\n\n1. Create a sequence of multiples of 7 starting with 0 times 7 (7).\n2. Increment by 7 each time to generate the next multiple in the sequence.\n3. Stop when we find a multiple that is greater than or equal to 45, as these numbers do not meet the criteria.\n4.

This can be represented by the inequality:\n\n    M + P > 14\n\nSince the cost of glue (G) is what we're trying to find, let's write an equation for George's total spending in terms of G:\n\n    23 = M + P + G\n\n**Step 3:** To solve this problem, we need to express one variable in terms of another and then use the given inequality.

If we were to perform the multiplication, it would look like this: (216*6)/(100*100) = 1296/10000.\n\nHowever, since we are dividing here, we flip the problem and find the reciprocal of the divisor (0.06). The reciprocal of 0.06 is 1/0.06 which equals 16.67 (when rounded to three decimal places). Now, our problem becomes 2.16 divided by 16.67.\n\nPerforming the division gives us approximately 0.1288 as a result. To three decimal places, it can be rounded to 0.129.\n\n\\n\\n<<Pie of Joy>>\n\nImagine now slices of a pie,\nEach slice representing the problem's side.\nTwelve and nine, two times multiplied,\nGive us the number of slices in our divide.\n\nOne slice for each whole part we see,\nAnother for each hundredth set free.\nSix slices for six hundredths in glee,\nSix thousandths as a final decree.\n\nTwelve and nine divided by sixteen and seven,\nA fractional division scene, the numbers saying when,\nThe number of slices now arranged and even,\nA pie's worth cut, with joy all around, given!"}

So, the number that multiplied with 1 over 88 makes 1 over 48 should be the same as the original number (88).\n\nSECTION 3: To find this number, we multiply both sides of the equation by 88 to eliminate the fractions.
