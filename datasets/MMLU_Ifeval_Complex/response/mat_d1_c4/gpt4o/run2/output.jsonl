Proportions essentially say that the ratios on either side are equal, resulting in a balance.\n\nSECTION 2\nFirst, simplify the fraction on the left-hand side. The fraction 48 over 88 can be reduced by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 48 and 88. The GCD of 48 and 88 is 8. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 8, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{48}{88} = \\frac{48/8}{88/8} = \\frac{6}{11}. \\]\n\nSECTION 3\nNow, we know that the simplified form of \\(\\frac{48}{88}\\) is \\(\\frac{6}{11}\\). By comparing this to our given proportion, \\(\\frac{?}{11}\\), it is clear that the number on the right-hand side must be 6 to maintain the equality.\n\\[ \\frac{6}{11} = \\frac{6}{11}. \\]\n\nSECTION 4\nThus, the missing number can be verified through cross multiplication. Cross multiplication involves multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other fraction. If the two products are equal, the fractions are equivalent:\n\\[ 48 \\times 11 = 88 \\times ?. \\]\n\\[ 528 = 88?. \\]\nSolving for ?, we have:\n\\[ ? = \\frac{528}{88} = 6. \\]\n\nSECTION 5\nTherefore, the number that makes the statement \\(\\frac{48}{88} = \\frac{?}{11}\\) true is 6. This shows how understanding and simplifying ratios can help in solving problems involving proportions.\n\nAny other questions?"}

Along with providing an answer to the question, give the mathematical equation that solves this problem. Wrap this (and only this) equation in a box. Use Latex style formatting to format the math equation. Highlight the final answer (and the final answer only) in bold.", "response": "To determine how many miles are represented by 5 inches on a map that uses a scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles, we need to use a straightforward multiplication based on the given ratio. The mathematical relationship between inches and miles is given as 1 inch equals 25 miles.\n\nFirst, it is important to understand the scale provided. In this map's context, each inch corresponds to 25 miles. This relationship is linear, meaning that for each additional inch, you add 25 more miles. For example, 2 inches would represent 50 miles, as each inch adds 25 miles.\n\nWe are given a measurement of 5 inches and asked to convert this into miles. According to the scale, the conversion can be performed by multiplying the map inches by the number of miles each inch represents. Consequently, we multiply the number of inches by 25 to find the total distance in miles.\n\nThus, the equation we need to solve is:\n\\[ \\boxed{5 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 25 \\, \\text{miles/inch}} \\]\n\nPerforming the multiplication, we get:\n\\[ 5 \\times 25 = 125 \\]\n\nTherefore, 5 inches on this map represent 125 miles. To ensure accuracy, it is effective to double-check by considering simpler increments. For instance, using 1 inch represents 25 miles and scaling up confirms our calculation:\n\\[ 2 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 25 \\, \\text{miles/inch} = 50 \\]\n\\[ 3 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 25 \\, \\text{miles/inch} = 75 \\]\n\\[ 4 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 25 \\, \\text{miles/inch} = 100 \\]\n\\[ 5 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 25 \\, \\text{miles/inch} = 125 \\]\n\nReiterating the multiplication, the steps confirm that the relationship holds consistently. Thus, 5 inches indeed map to 125 miles. The highlighted final answer should be clear:\n\n**125 miles**\n\nThis clear delineation helps verify the correct understanding of the scale. Consequently, the answer to the problem, ensuring clarity in mathematical communication, stands as:\n**125 miles**\n\nAny other questions?"}
