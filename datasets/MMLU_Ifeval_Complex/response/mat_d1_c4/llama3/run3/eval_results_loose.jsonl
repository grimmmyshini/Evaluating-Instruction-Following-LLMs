To solve this problem, we need to find a value that makes the two expressions equal. This involves finding the missing link between the two fractions.\n\nSECTION 2: Simplifying the Given Fraction\nLet's start by simplifying the given fraction, 48/88. We can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 48 and 88 is 8. So, we get:\n\n48 \u00f7 8 = 6\n88 \u00f7 8 = 11\n\nThe simplified fraction becomes 6/11.\n\nSECTION 3: Finding the Equivalent Fraction\nNow that we have a simplified version of the given fraction, let's find an equivalent fraction that will make the statement true. To do this, we need to find a number that when divided by 11 gives us 48 as the numerator and 88 as the denominator. Let's call this unknown value x.\n\nSECTION 4: Setting Up the Equation\nWe can set up an equation using the given information:\n\nx/11 = 48/88\n\nTo get rid of the denominator, we multiply both sides by 88:\n\nx = (48 \u00d7 88) / 11\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nx = 4224 / 11\n\nSECTION 5: Finding the Final Answer\nNow that we have the equation simplified, let's evaluate the expression. Divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 16 in this case.\n\n4224 \u00f7 16 = 264\n11 \u00f7 16 = 7/8\n\nThe final answer becomes:\n\n264 / (7/8) = 48/88\n\nSECTION: Any other questions?"}
