To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n$\\dfrac{25 \\text{ miles}}{1\\text{ inch}} * 5 = x$\n\nwhere x is the number of miles represented by 5 inches.\n\nWe can simplify the right-hand side of the equation as follows:\n\n$\\dfrac{25 \\text{ miles}}{1\\text{ inch}} * 5 = \\dfrac{125 \\text{ miles}}{\\text{inch}}$\n\nNow, we want to find x, which represents how many miles are represented by 5 inches. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5 again:\n\n$\\dfrac{125 \\text{ miles}}{1\\text{ inch}} * 5 = x$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$625 \\text{ miles} = x$\n\nSo, **625** miles are represented by 5 inches on this map."}
