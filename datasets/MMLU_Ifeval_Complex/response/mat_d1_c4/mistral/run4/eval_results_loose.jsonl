The points he scored should be less than 45 and also a multiple of 7. This means that the number should have 7 as one of its factors and not exceed 45.\n\nLet's first list some multiples of 7 up to 45: 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35. Since 35 is greater than 45, we can eliminate it from our possibilities.\n\n**Section 2**\n\nNow, let's review the remaining multiples of 7 less than 45: 7, 14, 21, and 28. The lowest among these is 7, but since Jaden scored points that are also less than 45, we need to find another multiple smaller than 7 that could possibly meet the requirements.\n\nLooking at multiples of 7, we see that the smallest difference between two consecutive multiples of 7 is 7 itself (e.g., from 7 to 14). Since we have already checked 7 and it does not meet the requirement of being less than 45, let's subtract that difference seven times:\n\n7 - 7 = 0, 0 - 7 = -7, -7 - 7 = -14, -14 - 7 = -21, -21 - 7 = -28, and -28 - 7 = -35.\n\nSince we have already ruled out -35, let's move on to the previous number: -28. However, this number is still greater than -45, so it also does not meet the condition of being less than 45.\n\nOur last option is to subtract 7 six times from the original multiple of 7 (7):\n\n7 - 7 = 0, 0 - 7 = -7, -7 - 7 = -14, -14 - 7 = -21, -21 - 7 = -28, and -28 - 7 = -35.\n\nThe sixth difference takes us below -45, so it's not a valid option as we are looking for a positive number of points that Jaden scored.\n\nBased on the given conditions, Jaden could not have scored any points according to the information provided in this scenario.

In this case, we will find the GCD for pairs of numbers and then the GCD of the resulting common divisors to reach our final answer.\n\nSection 3: Finding the Greatest Common Divisor\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, a method for finding the GCD of two numbers. In our case, let's start by finding the GCD of the first pair (54 and 36). We can do this by continuing the following process until one number is completely divisible by the other:\n- Divide the larger number by the smaller number (without remainder) to get a quotient.\n- Write down the smaller number as the new larger number.\n- Write down the remainder of the division as the new smaller number.\n- Repeat the process until one of the numbers is completely divisible, and we find our GCD.\n\nSection 4: Solving the Equations\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm, let's solve for the GCD of (54,36):\n\n```\n54  \u2223   36\n------------------\n1.65     21\n             3\n------------------\n                0\n```\n\nThe remainder is 0 when we divide 21 by 3, which means that their GCD is 3. Now, we know the GCD of (54 and 36) is 3. Next, find the GCD of this result (3) with the third number (24):\n\n```\n3   \u2223    24\n------------------\n1.8           3\n              0\n```\n\nThe remainder is again 0 when we divide 3 by 3, which means that their GCD is 3 as well. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 54, 36, and 24 is 3.\n\nSection 5: Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the GCD of numbers 54, 36, and 24 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm, as demonstrated in the previous steps. The final answer is that their greatest common divisor is 3.\n\nBy breaking down the problem into manageable steps and applying mathematical techniques systematically, we were able to find our solution successfully!"}

We know that when we have an absolute value (|x|), x can either be positive, zero, or negative. If x is positive, its absolute value is x itself; if x is zero, its absolute value is also zero; and if x is negative, its absolute value is the negative number's opposite, which is a positive number.\n\nIn this case, we have three numbers: 3 (positive), 5 (positive), -4 (negative), and four operations: addition, subtraction, absolute values, and no multiplication or division. So we can assume that the order of operations (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication & Division, Addition & Subtraction) follows the normal rules.\n\n**SECTION 2**\nLet's calculate the expressions one by one:\n1. First, find the absolute values for all three numbers: |3| = 3 and |-4| = 4 (since the absolute value of a negative number is its opposite)\n2. Then perform addition and subtraction as per the given order (remembering to take care of the signs appropriately). In this case, we have |3 + 5| \u2013 4: first add 3 and 5 which gives 8, then subtract 4 from 8, resulting in 4.\n\n**SECTION 3**\nNow that we have the final answer, let's write a Python function to solve this problem for any inputs:\n\n```python\ndef func63(a, b, c):\n    abs_a = abs(a)\n    abs_b = abs(b)\n    abs_c = abs(c)\n\n    result = abs(abs_a + abs_b - abs_c)\n    return result\n```\nYou can now call this function by passing appropriate arguments: `func63(3, 5, -4)`.

We are familiar with the multiplicative inverse of whole numbers up to 9 because all non-zero numbers below 10 have their reciprocals within this range.\n\nSECTION 2: Identifying the Problem\nGiven the expression 48 over 88 equals ? over 11, we can deduce that we are seeking the multiplicative inverse of the fraction 48/88. This problem requires us to find a value that, when multiplied by 48/88, will result in 1.\n\nSECTION 3: Finding the Multiplicative Inverse\nTo find the multiplicative inverse of a fraction, we can swap the numerator and denominator. So, the reciprocal of 48/88 becomes 88/48.\n\nSECTION 4: Simplifying the Resulting Fraction\nSince both numbers in our simplified fraction are even (factors of 2), we can divide them by their greatest common factor, which is 2, to get a simpler equivalent fraction: 44 over 24.\n\nSECTION 5: Determining the Final Answer and Validation\nNow that we have a simplified fraction representing our multiplicative inverse (88/48), we can see if it does indeed make the original expression true. Let's multiply 48/88 by its inverse (88/48):\n(48/88) * (88/48) = 1\nSince this product is 1, our simplified fraction (88/48) serves as the multiplicative inverse for the original fraction 48/88. To ensure that the given expression is true:\n(48/88) * (88/44) = 1 \\* (2) = 2\nSince the result of this calculation is 2, it means that we should instead find the multiplicative inverse of the fraction 48/44 to make the expression true.\n\nSECTION 6: Final Answer and Closing Statement\nTo rephrase our answer in terms of the original expression: We need to divide both numerator and denominator of the fraction 48 by 4, resulting in the fraction 12 over 11. Multiplying this fraction with 48/88 gives us an equivalent fraction (4 \\* 12) / (4 \\* 11) = 48/44.

Substitute the values, and we get 50 + x = CHR. Since our target is 120 beats per minute, so CHR = 120.\n\nSection 3\nNow we can solve for 'x', the increase in heart rate per minute: RHR + x = Target Heart Rate => x = (Target Heart Rate) - (RHR).
