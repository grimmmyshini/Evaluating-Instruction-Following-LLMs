Since Jan scored 3 more points than Salah, we can write this relation as `j = s + 3`.\n\nSecondly, we know that Cindy scored twice as many points as Jan, so `c = 2*j`. With some rearrangement of terms from the first equation, we get `j = (c - 2*3)/2`.\n\nNow that we have both expressions for `j` in terms of `s` and `c`, we can set them equal to each other. This gives us the following equality:\n\n`(c - 2*3) / 2 = s + 3`\n\nNext, let's solve for `s` from this equation. We first multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction on the left side:\n\n`c - 6 = 2*s + 6`, which simplifies to `c - 2*s = 6`.\n\nNow we can isolate the variable `s` by subtracting twice the value of `c` from both sides:\n\n`2*s = c - 6`, and finally solving for `s` gives us:\n\n`s = (c - 6) / 2`\n\nWe know that Cindy scored 22 points, so we can substitute this value of `c` into the equation for `s`. Let's find out how many points Salah scored:\n\n`s = (22 - 6) / 2`, which simplifies to `s = (16) / 2`, and finally `**s = 8**`.\n\nSo, **Salah scored 8 points**.\n\nHere's the Python function for solving the problem:\n\n```python\ndef func86(cindy_points):\n    salah_points = (cindy_points - 6) / 2\n    return salah_points\n```\n\nYou can now use this function to find out how many points Salah scored, given any value for Cindy's points.

Debnil has salt in **teaspoons**. The ratio of teaspoons to tablespoons is **3 : 1**. This means that for every 4 units (3+1) of measurement, there are 3 units in teaspoons and 1 unit in tablespoons.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the Given Quantity**\n\nSince we want to find out the number of tablespoons Debnil has, first we need to convert his current quantity (in teaspoons) into a quantity we can compare with the given ratio (in tablespoons). Let's denote Debnil's quantity in teaspoons as **D**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Ratio Constant**\n\nFrom the ratio, we know that for every 4 units of measurement, there are 3 parts in teaspoons and 1 part in tablespoons. Thus, the ratio constant (which is the number of parts in a single part in teaspoons) is **3**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Equivalent Quantity in Tablespoons**\n\nNow, we can calculate how many tablespoons Debnil's quantity would be by dividing Debnil's quantity in teaspoons (D) by the ratio constant (**3**) and multiplying the result by **1**. This is because each part of the given ratio represents 1 unit. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{Tablespoons = D \\cdot \\frac{1}{Ratio Constant} = D \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Calculation to Debnil's Quantity**\n\nFinally, we can use Debnil's quantity (6 teaspoons) in our equation:\n\n\\[ Tablespoons = 6 \\; teaspoons \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nThis calculation will give us the number of tablespoons Debnil has."}

In this competitive environment, we find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) between three numbers. Today, we will find the GCD of 54, 36, and 24.\n\n**Section 2: Problem Statement**\n\nThe task at hand is to determine the greatest common divisor of the given numbers: 54, 36, and 24.\n\n**Section 3: Methodology**\n\nTo find the GCD of multiple numbers, we can use the Euclidean Algorithm. This method involves finding the largest number that divides both of the two numbers in question without any remainder, then repeating this process with the new pair of numbers until one of them is a multiple of the other. The final number obtained in this process is the GCD.\n\n**Section 4: Solution**\n\nLet's find the GCD using the Euclidean Algorithm:\n1. Find the largest number divisible by both 54 and 36 without a remainder (in this case, that would be 36).\n2. Then, find the largest number divisible by both 36 and the remaining number (which is 24) without a remainder (in this case, that would be 12).\n3. Continue until we reach a pair where one number is a multiple of the other or the smallest possible number, in which case it's the GCD.\n\nIn our case, after two iterations, we find that the largest number divisible by both 12 and 24 is 12, making the GCD between 54 and 36 equal to 12. The GCD between 12 and 24 can be determined easily as they share a common divisor of 12 itself. Thus, the final GCD among all three numbers, 54, 36, and 24 is **12**.\n\n**Section 5: Final equation**\n\nHere's how we would express this in mathematical form:\n\n```\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\gcd(54, 36, 24) = \\gcd(\\gcd(54, 36), 24) = \\gcd(12, 24) = 12\n\\end{equation*}\n```\n\nThis equation breaks down the process of finding the GCD into smaller steps, making it clear that we first find the GCD of 54 and 36 before moving on to find the final GCD with 24."}

Thus, 0.75*X = 0.75*40.\n\n To express this result in terms of percentage of the original number (X), let's consider the percentage text on a shirt.

Let's break it down and make the calculation easier to understand:\n\nFirstly, notice that the divisor (0.06) can be represented as a fraction with a denominator of 100 (since 0.06 equals 6/100). This simplifies the division process in our heads or on paper.\n\nSecondly, we multiply the two numbers by converting the divisor to the same denominator as the dividend. In this case, since both numbers are initially decimals, they share the same denominator (base ten), but we'll still convert for clarity:\n\n- Multiply the numerator of the dividend (2) by the numerator of the divisor (6), resulting in 12. This step is essentially what would be done if you multiplied 2 by the denominator of the divisor, then by the numerator: (2 * 100) = 200 and (200 * 0.06) = 12.\n\n- Multiply the denominator of the dividend (10) by the denominator of the divisor (1), resulting in 10. This is necessary to maintain a consistent denominator for our final result, which should still be a decimal number.\n\nNow that we have the product of their respective numerators and denominators, we divide that product by the original denominator of the divisor: 12 \u00f7 100 = 0.12\n\nSo, the quotient of 2.16 \u00f7 0.06 is 0.12 when both numbers are represented as fractions with a common denominator (100) before performing the division.\n\n\\n\\n<<Pie>>\n\nSlices of pie may represent the different parts of this calculation process: starting with two whole numbers, converting one to a fraction, multiplying and dividing those parts, then finally finding the quotient.

Since the LCM is just the larger of the two numbers (12), we now have our common multiplier.\n\nSECTION 3: Multiplying Both Sides by the Common Multiplier\nNow, multiply both sides of the equation by the common multiplier (12). On the left side, we get (4 * 12) * 12 = (48 * 12) and on the right side, it becomes ? * 1 * 12 = ? * 12.\n\nSECTION 4: Solving for the Unknown\nNow that both sides have the same numbers, we can solve for the unknown variable. It's easy to see that if 48 * 12 equals the other side of the equation, then the solution must be 4 * 12 because multiplication is commutative (the order in which we multiply numbers does not change their product).\n\nSECTION 5: Final Result and Conclusion\nThe final result that makes the original statement true is 4/11.
