According to the problem, Jan scored 3 more points than Salah. Therefore, if Salah scored `S` points, then Jan scored `S + 3` points. Next, it's mentioned that Cindy scored 22 points, which is twice the points scored by Jan. Using this information, we can create the equation depicting Cindy's score: \n\n\\[ 22 = 2 \\times (S + 3) \\]\n\n***\n**Section 3**\nWe need to solve the equation for `S` to find Salah's score. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 22 = 2S + 6 \\]\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 16 = 2S \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ S = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, Salah scored **8** points.\n\n***\n**Section 4**\nTo implement this in a Python function named `func86`, we need to derive the points based on the given relationships.

This means for every 3 teaspoons, there is 1 tablespoon. \n\n**Step 2:** Next, convert the number of teaspoons into tablespoons using the provided ratio. Since we have 6 teaspoons, we will divide this by the ratio's number of teaspoons (which is 3) to find how many tablespoons there are.\n\n**Step 3:** Perform the division. To find out how many tablespoons Debnil has, you divide the number of teaspoons (6) by the ratio's number of teaspoons (3):\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{6}{3} = 2}\n\\]\n\nSo, Debnil has 2 tablespoons of salt.

According to the rule of signs, when you divide two numbers with the same sign, the quotient is positive.\n\nFirst, let's state the mathematical equation that needs to be solved:\n\n\\[\n-40 \\div (-8) = x\n\\]\n\nSince both the dividend and the divisor are negative, their signs cancel each other out, leading to a positive result.

The map scale tells us that each inch on the map represents 25 miles in the real world. Therefore if we have 5 inches on the map we want to find out how those 5 inches convert to miles. \n\nThe mathematical operation here involves multiplying the number of inches by the number of miles each inch represents. Specifically we have 5 inches and each of these inches corresponds to 25 miles. When performing this calculation we utilize basic multiplication. The equation can be written as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5 \\text{ inches} \\times 25 \\text{ miles/inch}}\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying 5 by 25 we get:\n\n\\(5 \\times 25 = 125\\)\n\nThus the 5 inches on the map correspond to 125 miles in the real world. So to restate the situation when we see 5 inches on the map it effectively means 125 miles in actuality.\n\nMapping scales are essential for understanding real-world distances when looking at maps. By using the scale properly one can convert any measurement on the map to determine the actual distance. It helps in navigation and planning trips ensuring accuracy.\n\nAdditionally this conversion can be performed for any number of inches by multiplying the inches by 25 miles. For example 3 inches would represent \\(3 \\times 25 = 75\\) miles. Similarly 10 inches would represent \\(10 \\times 25 = 250\\) miles.\n\nKnowing how to use a map scale does not only apply to navigational maps but is also useful in various fields such as urban planning geography and even during educational purposes. It is also worth noting different maps may use different scales but the method to convert remains essentially the same.\n\nIn summary to answer the initial question 5 inches on this particular map represent **125 miles**. Always ensure to refer back to the map scale being used to make accurate conversions as necessary.\n\nAny other questions?"}
