Given that Cindy scored 22 points, we need to determine Salah's score based on this information.\n\n***\n\nSection 2\n\nFirst, let's define variables for each person's points. Let `S` be Salah's score, `J` be Jan's score, and `C` be Cindy's score. From the problem statement, we know the following relations:\n\n1. \\( J = S + 3 \\)\n2. \\( C = 2J \\)\n3. \\( C = 22 \\)\n\nWe can use these relations to calculate Salah's score by substituting known values step-by-step.\n\n***\n\nSection 3\n\nFrom the third relation, we have \\( C = 22 \\). Plugging this into the second relation gives us \\( 22 = 2J \\). Solving this equation for \\( J \\) (Jan's score) results in \\( J = 11 \\). Now that we know Jan's score is 11, we can use the first relation to find Salah's score: \\( J = S + 3 \\). Substituting \\( J = 11 \\) into this equation, we get \\( 11 = S + 3 \\). Simplifying this, we find that \\( S = 8 \\).\n\n***\n\nSection 4\n\nTherefore, the number of points Salah scored is 8. To ensure that our solution is correct, let's verify the steps: Cindy scored 22 points, which is twice Jan's points. Hence, \\( 22 = 2 \\times 11 \\), confirming Jan's score is 11. Furthermore, Jan scored 3 more points than Salah, so \\( 11 - 3 = 8 \\), verifying that Salah scored 8 points.\n\n***\n\nSection 5\n\nBelow is the Python function `func86` that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef func86():\n    # Given Cindy's score\n    C = 22\n    \n    # Calculate Jan's score, as Cindy scored twice as many points as Jan\n    J = C // 2\n    \n    # Calculate Salah's score, as Jan scored 3 more points than Salah\n    S = J - 3\n    \n    return S\n\n# Running the function to get Salah's score\nsalah_score = func86()\nprint(f\"Salah's Score: {salah_score}\")\n```\n\nExecuting this function confirms that Salah's score is **8**."}

The absolute value of -40 is 40, and the absolute value of -8 is 8. Therefore, we proceed by dividing 40 by 8.\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n40 divided by 8 equals 5. \n\nGiven that both original numbers were negative, the quotient of -40 divided by -8 is also positive. Thus, the result of -40 \u00f7 -8 is 5.\n\nSo, the answer to the problem is 5. \n\nIt's important to note that understanding the rules of multiplying and dividing negative numbers is crucial in algebra. These rules help us to simplify and solve many problems accurately.\n\nFor instance, if you had two negative numbers in a multiplication or division problem, the result would be positive. Conversely, if one number were negative and the other positive, the result would be negative.\n\nBy summarizing, the rule states: \n- Negative \u00f7 Negative = Positive \n- Negative \u00d7 Negative = Positive \n- Positive \u00f7 Negative = Negative \n- Negative \u00f7 Positive = Negative\n\nUsing this rule, we can solve similar problems with ease.

Imagine if you were calculating debts and expenses.

The relationship between inches and miles on this map is linear and can be mathematically expressed. The fundamental question here asks for the total number of miles that correspond to a specific number of inches on the map. Specifically we need to calculate how many miles are represented by 5 inches. \n\nTo do this we will simply multiply the number of inches by the number of miles per inch. Essentially we are scaling up the given ratio of 1 inch equals 25 miles. Using the equation we have\n\n\\[ \\text{Miles} = \\text{Inches} \\times 25 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given value of 5 inches into the equation we get:\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\text{Miles} = 5 \\times 25 }\\]\n\nPerforming the multiplication we get the result:\n\n\\[ \\text{Miles} = 125 \\]\n\nHence the number of miles represented by 5 inches on the map is **125**. We arrived at this conclusion by scaling the given relationship of 1 inch to 25 miles up to 5 inches which involved a simple yet crucial multiplication operation. This exercise demonstrates the application of proportional thinking in map reading and scaling. Understanding how to scale distances on a map can be very useful in navigation and planning trips. It is an essential skill for geographers cartographers and even for everyday travelers. The concept of a map scale is foundational in both geography and cartography. When we know the scale of a map we can accurately interpret distances between various locations depicted on the map. The process of calculating distances using the map scale is straightforward as shown. This ability to convert map measurements to real-life distances ensures that maps remain practical tools for conveying spatial information.
