When you divide a negative number by another negative number, the result is a positive number. This is because dividing two numbers with the same sign (both positive or both negative) yields a positive quotient.\n\nNegative signs essentially cancel each other out in division. Hence, dividing \\(-40\\) by \\(-8\\) simplifies to dividing \\(40\\) by \\(8\\) while dropping the negative signs. Now, \\(40\\) divided by \\(8\\) results in \\(5\\). \n\nSo, the quotient of \\(-40\\) divided by \\(-8\\) is \\(5\\).\n\nHere's the mathematical representation of the solution:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{-40}{-8} = 5}\n\\]\n\nIn a more detailed step-by-step method, it can be helpful to remember the rule: when you divide two negative numbers, the quotient is positive. Therefore, removing the negative signs from both numbers makes the division straightforward, and thus, \\(40\\) divided by \\(8\\) equals \\(5\\).\n\nThis basic rule of arithmetic is fundamental in various mathematical contexts. For example, in algebra, you often simplify expressions by canceling out common factors, and understanding how to handle negative numbers is critical. In real life, this understanding helps in financial calculations, engineering analyses, and even computer programming.\n\nMoreover, confirming that the signs cancel out is vital; otherwise, you could end up with the incorrect sign in your answer. If it had been \\(40\\) divided by \\(-8\\), the result would have been \\(-5\\) since a positive divided by a negative number yields a negative result.\n\nIn summary, correct handling of negative signs during division is crucial for accurate calculations. Being thorough in this process helps prevent errors and ensures the integrity of mathematical solutions. Is this more clear now? Understanding these rules deepens your comprehension of mathematics as a whole.\n\nTo reiterate, the quotient of \\(-40\\) divided by \\(-8\\) can be determined using the equation provided. Negative divided by negative simplifies to a positive result, and the quotient is \\(5\\). I hope this explanation is helpful and clear.\""}
