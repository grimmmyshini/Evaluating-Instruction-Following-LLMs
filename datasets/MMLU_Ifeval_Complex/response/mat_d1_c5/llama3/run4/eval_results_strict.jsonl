Once the condition is met, the function returns Salah's final score.\n\n***\n\n\nSection 4: Solution\nLet's run the Python function `func86` to find Salah's score:\n```python\nprint(func86())\n```\n**Salah scored **15 points** in the basketball game.**\n\n***\n\n\nSection 5: Conclusion\nThe function `func86` successfully solves the problem by iteratively updating the scores until Cindy's score is equal to 22, which is twice Jan's score.
