A half can be written as 1/2. So, in total, our mixed number is equivalent to (5 + 4/2) or (9/2). This can also be simplified since 9 is divisible by 2, giving us a fraction of 4.5/2 or 2.25 in mixed number form.\n\n**SECTION 4**\nTo provide the mathematical equation that solves this problem:\n\n\\boxed{0.875 * 2^n = integer \\Rightarrow n = log_2(0.875^{-1}) \\text{ and } 5 + (4/2) = (9/2)}\n\n**SECTION 5**\nIn summary, the decimal 5.875 is equivalent to the mixed number **2 1/2 or the fraction 5/2 in simplest form.**"}

Here, we focus on the expression 64 + 8.\n\n**Step 2:** The expression 64 + 8 consists of two numbers (64 and 8) and an arithmetic operation (+). The number 64 is called the **first addend**, and the number 8 is the **second addend**.\n\n**Step 3:** To perform this addition, we follow simple rules: find the sum of the first addend (64) and the second addend (8).\n\n**Step 4:** The operation here is addition. So, to get the total value, simply combine the two numbers by following the order from left to right: 64 + 8 = 72.\n\n**Step 5:** This expression can be used in various scenarios, such as in solving mathematical problems or when dealing with data analysis in different fields like finance, physics, engineering, and more. For example, if you want to calculate the total cost of 64 items at $0.08 per item, this expression would be helpful (cost = 64 * 0.08).\n\n**Step 6:** However, it's essential to remember that mathematical expressions can only represent numerical values or variables, and not historical events, as the word 'historian' suggests. So, an expression like 64 + 8 won't be used in history studies.\n\n**Step 7:** The result of 64 + 8 is a concrete number (72), which can help us make calculations or comparisons easily.

In our case, we will find the common divisor of 54, 36, and 24.\n\n**Section 3: Prime Factorization**\n\nFirst, let's break down each number into their prime factors.

In this case, we can see that the common factors are '2' and '3'. However, since we are looking for the largest divisor (GCD), we will focus only on the highest powers of '2' (3) and '3' (3).\n\n**Section 5: Final Answer**\n\nNow that we have determined the maximum power of the common factors, the GCD is given by finding the least common multiple (LCM) for those two numbers and then taking the square root. Since '2' is raised to the third power in our problem, and '3' is only raised to the first power, we can simply take the product of '3' and the cube root of '8' (since 2^3 = 8).\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\boxed{\\text{{GCD}(54, 36, 24) = \\sqrt[3]{8} \\cdot 3 = 3\\sqrt[3]{8}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn simpler terms, the GCD of 54, 36, and 24 is $3\\sqrt[3]{8}$.

Let us perform the division. We multiply the divisor (0.06) by 100 to facilitate mental calculations. This gives us 60. We then count forward from the dividend (216) that many times in groups of 100, which is three times (since 3 * 100 = 300 < 216). Now we subtract our count (3 * 100 = 300) from the dividend to get the remainder. This gives us 16.\n\nNow that we have the quotient and the remainder, let us convert back to its original decimal form by dividing the quotient (3 in this case) by 100. We obtain 0.03. The remainder, however small, has no place in our division problem as we are seeking the quotient only. Hence, the quotient of 2.16 divided by 0.06 is 33.33 (when rounded to three decimal places).\n\n<<poem of joy>>\nIn numbers, we find sweet solace,\nDivide and multiply with grace.\nThirty-three and a thousandth's part,\nThe answer of our heart's delightful art.\nIn the dance of digits, there is no remorse,\nOnly a joyous embrace of mathematical course."}
