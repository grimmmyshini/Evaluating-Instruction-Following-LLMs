The equation currently tells us that three-halves times a number \\( w \\) equals 66.\n\n\n**Step 2:** To isolate \\( w \\), we need to get rid of the fraction. Since it is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) multiplied to \\( w \\), we do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the inverse of \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), which is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n\n**Step 3:** When we multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), we get:\n\n\\[ w = 66 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate \\( 66 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ w = 66 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 66 \\times 0.6667 = 44 \\]\n\n\n**Step 5:** Now that we have the value of \\( w \\), we know \\( w = 44 \\).\n\nNext, we will implement a PYTHON function named FUNC7 to solve this problem.

Given that computations of this size only take a MINUTE, it's fairly straightforward to verify.\n\nIncidentally, this approach can be generalized for similar equations. Rather than solving manually every SINGLE time, a Python function like FUNC7 will ensure efficiency. By handling with COMPUTATIONAL precision, we secure accurate results.\n\nIn MINUTE tasks involving fractions and variables, it's best to handle using a systematic code approach. This greatly minimizes error risks and maximizes productivity.

According to the problem statement:\n- Jan scored \\( S + 3 \\) points.\n- Cindy scored 22 points, and we know that this is twice the number of points Jan scored. Thus, we can write the equation: \\( 22 = 2 \\times (S + 3) \\).\n\n***\n\nSection 3\n\nNow, let's solve the equation to determine the value of \\( S \\). We can set up the equation as follows:\n\\[ 22 = 2 \\times (S + 3) \\]\n\\[ 22 = 2S + 6 \\]\nSubtract 6 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( S \\):\n\\[ 22 - 6 = 2S \\]\n\\[ 16 = 2S \\]\nFinally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( S \\):\n\\[ S = 8 \\]\nThus, Salah scored **8** points.\n\n***\n\nSection 4\n\nHere is the Python function implementation that calculates the number of points Salah scored using the provided information:\n\n```python\ndef func86():\n    # Cindy's known score and the fact that her score is twice Jan's score\n    cindy_score = 22\n    jan_score = cindy_score // 2\n    \n    # Jan scored 3 more points than Salah\n    salah_score = jan_score - 3\n    \n    return salah_score\n\n# Display the result\nprint(\"Salah scored:\", func86())  # Expected output: Salah scored: 8\n```\n\n***\n\nSection 5\n\nThe function `func86` first calculates Jan's score by dividing Cindy's score by 2. Then it finds Salah's score by subtracting 3 from Jan's score. When you run the function, it will return and print that Salah scored **8** points, consistently matching our manual calculation above. \n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"}

The problem states that the ratio of teaspoons to tablespoons is 3:1. This means for every 3 teaspoons, there is 1 tablespoon of salt.\n\n**Step 2:** Set up the ratio equation based on the given values.

The total number of pennies they had initially saved was 720 pennies. With 250 pennies deposited in the bank, the number of pennies remaining in their possession needed to be calculated.

It's important to remember that dividing a negative number by another negative number results in a positive number. This principle applies universally in mathematics and often guides us in solving such equations.\n\nThe first step is to identify both the dividend and the divisor. In this case, \\(-40\\) is the dividend and \\(-8\\) is the divisor. This sets the stage for our calculation. In arithmetic, a negative divided by a negative results in a positive. This is a crucial point to remember.\n\nNow, let's proceed by dividing the absolute values of the numbers. The absolute value of \\(-40\\) is \\(40\\), and the absolute value of \\(-8\\) is \\(8\\). When you divide \\(40\\) by \\(8\\), you get \\(5\\).\n\nTherefore, since both the original numbers were negative, the result of their division is positive. Consequently, the quotient of \\(-40\\) divided by \\(-8\\) is \\(5\\).\n\nTo summarize, the mathematical equation that solves this problem can be represented as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-40 \\div (-8) = 5}\n\\]\n\nThis equation confirms that the quotient is indeed \\(5\\).\n\nWhen solving problems like this, it\u2019s beneficial to be a fan of clear logical steps.

Verifying steps prevents errors and reinforces learning. Reviewing the core principles behind signs and division is always a good step in reinforcing math fundamentals. The quotient derived not only gives a numerical answer but also showcases the importance of sign rules in division.\n\nIn conclusion, the process involves converting the negatives to positives through division. By breaking down each step and following arithmetic principles, you can clearly arrive at the solution. The steps may seem simple, but they underscore an essential mathematical principle.\n\nEven as a fan of more complicated math, recognizing these foundational steps ensures accuracy.

Hence, the missing number is 6.\n\nSECTION 3\n\n**Step 6:** Conclusion\nThus, the number that makes the statement:\n\\[ \\frac{48}{88} = \\frac{6}{11} \\]\nis 6.\n\nSECTION 4\n\nTo automate finding such numbers in similar problems, we can write a Python function. Below is the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef func24(numerator, denominator, new_denominator):\n    gcd_value = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n    simplified_numerator = numerator // gcd_value\n    simplified_denominator = denominator // gcd_value\n    if simplified_denominator == new_denominator:\n        return simplified_numerator\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"The problem constraints do not simplify to the new denominator directly.\")\n\n# Example usage\nprint(func24(48, 88, 11))  # Output: 6\n```\n\nSECTION 5\n\nThe provided Python function `func24` takes three arguments: the numerator and denominator of the initial fraction, and the new denominator of the right-hand fraction. It simplifies the fraction first and checks for equality with the new denominator to return the corresponding numerator. \n\nAny other questions?"}

The map scale is given as 1 inch equals 25 miles. This means that for every inch on the map it corresponds to 25 real miles on the ground. If you extend this ratio to more inches you calculate the number of miles represented. \n\nFirst let's start by understanding that the given scale is a direct ratio. Knowing this we can set up a mathematical equation to solve for the number of miles represented by 5 inches. You multiply the number of inches by the scale factor which in this case is 25 miles per inch. Therefore if there are 5 inches to convert you simply multiply 5 by 25.\n\nThe equation to find the number of miles represented by 5 inches can be written as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Miles} = \\text{Inches} \\times \\text{Scale}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Miles} = 5 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 25 \\, \\text{miles/inch}\n\\]\n\nSolving this computation we find:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Miles} = 125 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\nTherefore 5 inches on this map represents a total of **125 miles**. This final answer provides the exact number of miles that the scale covers when extended to 5 inches. Understanding how to use the given scale factor to convert between inches and miles is crucial for reading maps accurately.\n\nThis type of problem is commonly faced in geography and cartography where understanding the scale of a map is necessary for accurate distance measurement. Being able to quickly convert between map inches and real-life miles is a valuable skill especially in fields that involve navigation or travel planning.\n\nBy practicing these types of conversions you enhance your capability to interpret maps and utilize them effectively. Remember to always check the map's legend for the scale information before making any conversions.\n\nIf you have larger or smaller distances to convert using this scale you apply the same method by adjusting the number of inches accordingly. This straightforward multiplication process makes it easy to calculate distances of any length represented on a map. \n\nAlways ensure that you understand the units involved whether they are miles inches kilometers or centimeters. This helps avoid any confusion and ensures accurate distance representation. Practice with various scales and distances to become adept at these conversions. Familiarity with such calculations can greatly enhance both practical and academic applications.\n\nAny other questions?"}
