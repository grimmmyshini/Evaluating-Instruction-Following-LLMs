This is a linear equation in the form y = mx + c, where m = 1.5 and c = 66.\n\n**Step 2:**\nTo solve for w, we need to isolate w on one side of the equation.

Let x be the number of points Salah scored. Since Jan scored 3 more points than Salah, Jan scored x + 3. We know that Cindy scored twice as many points as Jan, so Cindy scored 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6.\n\nWe are given that Cindy scored 22 points, so we can set up the equation:\n\n2x + 6 = 22\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x = 16\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we find that x = **8**. Therefore, Salah scored **8** points.\n\n***Section 5: Conclusion***\n\nIn conclusion, the Python function `func86` helps us to solve this problem efficiently and accurately. With the given information, it calculates Salah's points to be **8**."}

When you're dividing numbers, you're basically asking how many times one number fits into another. In this case, we want to know how many times -8 fits into -40.\n\nLet's start by writing out our equation in box form:\n\n```\n\\boxed{-40 \\div -8 = ?}\n```\n\nNow that we have our equation set up, let's think about what it means to divide -40 by -8.

When you're moving forward with a negative number, it's like facing a strong headwind from a fan \u2013 you need to adjust your approach to account for that wind.\n\nIn this case, we know that both numbers are negative, so we can use a trick. Since -8 is essentially just 8 with a minus sign in front of it, we can think about how many times 8 fits into 40. If we're counting up from zero, we'd say 5, because 8 x 5 = 40. But since the numbers are negative, we need to flip our thinking and count down from 0 instead. This means we'll start with -4 (because -8 x -4 = 32), then go back another step to -5 (-8 x -5 = 40).\n\nSo, the quotient of -40 divided by -8 is indeed -5! We can write our final answer as:\n\n```\n-40 \\div -8 = \\boxed{-5}\n```\n\nAnd there you have it \u2013 a nice, tidy solution to our division problem.

By examining these factors, we can determine the GCD.\n\n**Section 2: Prime Factorization**\n\nThe prime factorization of each number is:\n\n* 54 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\n* 36 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\n* 24 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3\n\n**Section 3: GCD Calculation**\n\nTo find the GCD, we will identify the common prime factors among the three numbers. The common factors are:\n\n* 2 (appears in all three numbers)\n* 3 (appears in all three numbers)\n\nUsing these common factors, we can write the GCD as:\n\nGCD = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n\n**Section 4: Solution**\n\nThe greatest common divisor of 54, 36, and 24 is 6. To represent this equation mathematically, we use the following box:\n\n$$\\gcd(a,b,c)=\\text{lcm}\\left(\\frac{a}{\\gcd(a,b,c)}, \\frac{b}{\\gcd(a,b,c)}, \\frac{c}{\\gcd(a,b,c)}\\right)$$\n\nIn our case, a = 54, b = 36, and c = 24. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n$$\\gcd(54, 36, 24) = 6$$\n\n**Section 5: Conclusion**\n\nIn the league of GCDs, it seems that both 2 and 3 are strong sides, as they appear together in all three numbers.

But the second box is actually a little smaller than the first one.\n\n***According to our information, the second box has 58 fewer books than the first box. Let's say the number of books in the second box is x. Since there are 58 fewer books in the second box than the first box, we can set up an equation like this: x = 136 - 58.\n\n***Now that we have this equation, we can solve for x. If you substitute 136 into the equation, you get: x = 136 - 58 = 78. So the second box has 78 books in it.\n\n***Now that we know how many books are in each box, we can add them up to find the total number of books. This is easy: 136 (books in the first box) + 78 (books in the second box) = **164**.\n\n\"Is there anything else I can help with?\""}

So, our equation is:\n\n**x = 25 \u00d7 5**\n\nSECTION 2\n\nWe know that the map's scale is 1:25, which can also be written as a fraction: 25/1. Since we want to find out how many miles are represented by 5 inches, we can multiply this ratio by 5.\n\nSo, our equation **x = 25 \u00d7 5** is equivalent to the equation:\n\n**x = (25/1) \u00d7 5**\n\nNow, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation by multiplying the fraction and the number 5. This gives us:\n\n**x = (25 \u00d7 5)/1**\n**x = 125/1**\n**x = 125**\n\nSo, **x = 125** is our answer.\n\nAny other questions?"}
