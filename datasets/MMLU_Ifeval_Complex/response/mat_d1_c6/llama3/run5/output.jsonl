How many miles are represented by 5 inches on this map? The key to solving this problem is understanding that the scale tells us that each inch on the map represents a certain number of miles in real life, so we can multiply the length on the map (in inches) by the distance corresponding to one inch on the map.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to recognize that 1 inch on the map corresponds to 25 miles. Therefore, if we have 5 inches, we would have 5 times as much distance. So we can multiply the number of inches by the distance per inch. The equation that solves this problem is:\n\n{25x}\n\nThis equation tells us that for every x inches, we have 25x miles.\n\nSECTION 2\nPlugging in the value of 5 inches, we get:\n\n{25*5}"}
