So, 5.875 as a mixed number is **5 3/4**.\n\n**SECTION 2**\nTo express 5.875 as a fraction, we simply multiply the decimal part by a power of ten to get an integer.

The number 5.875, when converted into a mixed number, takes us on a journey from the realm of decimals to that of fractions.

The number 5.875, when expressed as a mixed number or fraction, loses its confinement within the decimal system, expanding its horizons to explore new forms and possibilities. This reflects the essence of freedom - the ability to explore, transform, and expand beyond our initial constraints. Similarly, poetry offers us this freedom to express, experiment, and explore the depths of human emotions and experiences. In the end, both math and poetry remind us of the beauty that lies in transformation and discovery."}

Let `S` be the score of Salah, `J` be the score of Jan, and `C` be the score of Cindy.\n2. We know that `J = S + 3`. This represents that Jan scored 3 more points than Salah.\n3. We also know that `C = 2 * J`. This states that Cindy scored double the number of points Jan scored.\n\n***\n**Section 2**\nTo solve for the unknowns, we can start by using equation #2 (C = 2*J) to eliminate one variable (Jan's score). We find an expression for Jan's score in terms of Cindy's: `J = C / 2`.\n\nNext, we substitute this expression into the first equation (J = S + 3), yielding: `(C/2) = S + 3` or `S = (C/2) - 3`, where now, Salah's score is expressed in terms of Cindy's.\n\n***\n**Section 3**\nHowever, we don't know the value for Cindy's score yet, so we cannot find Salah's score directly. To get a specific numerical answer, we need additional information about one of the players (ideally Cindy). If we knew Cindy's score, we could use it to calculate Jan's and Salah's scores through our expressions.\n\nFor example, if Cindy scored 22 points, then according to our expressions, Jan would have scored `(C / 2) = (22 / 2) = 11` points and Salah would have scored `S = (C/2) - 3 = 8` points.\n\n***\n**Section 4**\nTo create a Python function that solves this problem, we can define it to take in the score of Cindy and return the scores for both Salah and Jan. Here's an example implementation of the `func86`:\n```python\ndef func86(cindy_score):\n    jan_score = cindy_score / 2\n    salah_score = jan_score - 3\n\n    return salah_score, jan_score\n\n# Test the function with a specific score for Cindy:\nsalah_score, jan_score = func86(22)\nprint(\"Salah scored \" + str(salah_score))\nprint(\"Jan scored \" + str(jan_score))\n```\nYou can call this function with different values of Cindy's score to get the corresponding scores for Salah and Jan.\n\n***\n**Section 5**\nWith the Python implementation provided, you now have a function that can find the points scored by Salah and Jan in the basketball game given any value for Cindy's score. If there are no additional questions or information needed about this problem, here is the solution:\n\n<<poem of joy>>\nIn our basketball problem, we learned that:\n- Cindy scored twice as many points as Jan; and,\n- Jan scored 3 more points than Salah.\n\nBy eliminating one variable (Jan's score), we found that Salah's score can be expressed as `S = (C/2) - 3`. If you know the value for Cindy's score, you can easily calculate both Jan and Salah's scores using this equation.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"}

This value is the largest number that divides all the given numbers without leaving a remainder. In this case, let us find the GCD of 54, 36, and 24.\n\nSection 2: Defining the Problem\n\nThe problem can be defined as follows: Given three integers (54, 36, and 24), we need to determine their greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm or any other mathematical method.\n\nSection 3: Providing a Solution\n\nFirst, let's apply the Euclidean algorithm:\n- Find the larger number (in this case, 54 and 36). The larger number is divided by the smaller number to find their quotient and remainder. In this case, we have 54 divided by 36 equals 1 with a remainder of 24.\n- Repeat this process using the quotient (1) and the previous remainder (24): 24 divided by 1 equals 24 with a remainder 0. Since there is no remainder, we have found the GCD between the given numbers.\n\nSection 4: Mathematical Equation\n\nTo solve this problem mathematically, use the following equation:\n```\n\\begin{aligned}\nGCD(a, b) &= a \\quad \\quad \\text{if $b$ is divisible by $a$,}\\\\\n          &= GCD(b, r) \\quad \\text{otherwise, where $r = a - (q \\times b)$, and $q$ is the largest integer such that $r \\leq b$.}\n\\end{aligned}\n```\nUsing this equation, we can solve for our problem:\nGCD(54, 36) = GCD(36, 24) = GCD(24, 0). Since the remainder is 0 when dividing 24 by the previous quotient, the GCD of the given numbers is 24.\n\nSection 5: Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 54, 36, and 24 is 24.

The divisor (the number by which we are dividing) is 7 and the dividend (the number being divided) is 21.\n\nHere is the equation representing this:\n\n```\n\\boxed{21 = _{\\hspace{30px}} \\times 7 + R}\n```\n\n**Step 2:** First, we perform as many multiplications of 7 as possible without exceeding 21. We can multiply 7 three times (since 7*3=21-6), resulting in 21 - 6*7 = 15.\n\nHere is the updated equation:\n\n```\n\\boxed{21 = 3 \\times 7 + 15}\n```\n\n**Step 3:** Since we cannot divide 15 by 7 with no remainder, we subtract 7 from 15 as many times as possible. We can do this once (since 7*1=7 and 15 - 7 = 8), resulting in the quotient 1 and a remainder of 8.\n\nHowever, we are finding the remainder when dividing 21 by 7, not 15 by 7. Since there were three multiplications of 7 in the first place, the remainder for the division of 21 by 7 should be 3 times the remainder found here, which is 8*3=24, but we are looking for the **remainder**, not the result of multiplication. So the remainder when dividing 21 by 7 is actually 8 - 7 = **1**.\n\n**Step 4:** Therefore, the answer to your question is:\n\nThe remainder of 21 divided by 7 is **1**."}

Here's how to find the median in the given data:\n\n**Step 1:** Arrange the data in ascending order. This helps us visualize the midpoint of the dataset and ensure fairness when finding the median. So, our ordered dataset becomes: **13**, **18**, **23**, **25**, **29**, **32**.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine if there is an odd or even number of observations. In this case, we have **6 observations**. Odd numbers of observations split the list into two parts (half and half), while even numbers result in two equal groups. For this problem, since there are 6 observations, we have an odd number.\n\n**Step 3:** If we have an odd number of observations, find the middle observation to determine the median. In our case, since there are 6 observations, the 3rd value from both ends (indices 2 and 4) should be considered: **18**, **23**. The middle value between these two numbers is their average: (18 + 23) / 2 = **20.5**.\n\n**Step 4:** For even number of observations, the median would be the average of the two middle values. In such a case, you can find more than one pair of 'middle' values when counting from either end of the ordered list. For example, with 8 observations: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} will give us four pairs of 'mid' values (1-4, 1-5, 2-4, 2-5). In such cases, we take the average of those two middle values.\n\n**Step 5:** For this dataset, we do not need to find the average of multiple middle values as it has an odd number of observations. The median is **20.5**. Is there anything else I can help with?\n\nHere's the Python function called func99 for finding the median:\n\n```python\ndef func99(data):\n    sorted_data = sorted(data)  # Step 1\n    number_of_obs = len(sorted_data)\n    if number_of_obs % 2 == 0:  # Check for an even number of observations\n        median_index_average = (number_of_obs//2 - 1) // 2   # Get indices of middle two values for average\n        return (sorted_data[median_index_average] + sorted_data[median_index_average+1]) / 2    # Step 3 (for even number of observations)\n    else:                             # Check for an odd number of observations\n        median_index = number_of_obs // 2   # Get the index of the middle value\n        return sorted_data[median_index]   # Step 3 (for odd number of observations)\n```"}
