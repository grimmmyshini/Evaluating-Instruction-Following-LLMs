If any professor can be assigned to teach any course, how many different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses are possible?

Each professor needs to be assigned to teach 2 courses, and each course needs to be assigned to 1 professor.\n\nWe can solve this problem by counting the number of ways to choose 2 courses for each of the 10 professors. This can be done using combinations:\n\n$$C(20,2) = 20 * 19 / 2 = 190$$\n\nTherefore, there are **190** different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses possible."}
