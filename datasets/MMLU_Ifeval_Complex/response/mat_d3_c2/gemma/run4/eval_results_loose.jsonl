Statement 1 suggests that rearranging the terms of a diverging series can lead to convergence, which violates the fundamental properties of divergent series. Statement 2 introduces the idea of continuous functions that map closed and bounded sets to non-closed and bounded sets, which seems counterintuitive.\n\n## Paragraph 1: Divergent Series and Rearrangement\n\nThe statement regarding the rearrangement of a divergent series highlights a crucial mathematical principle. While the sum of a divergent series is undefined, the series itself can be rearranged to yield different results. However, this rearrangement cannot lead to convergence of the series.\n\n## Paragraph 2: Metric Spaces and Continuous Functions\n\nThe introduction of metric spaces and continuous functions adds another layer of complexity to the problem. A closed and bounded set in a metric space is one that contains all its limit points. A continuous function simply maps points from one space to another while preserving their neighborhood structure.\n\n## Paragraph 3: Counterintuitive Mapping\n\nThe claim that there exists a continuous function that maps a closed and bounded set to a set that is not closed and bounded seems counterintuitive. This implies that the function does not preserve the fundamental properties of closed and bounded sets in the target space.\n\n## Paragraph 4: Connecting the Statements\n\nIt is difficult to reconcile the two statements. The rearrangement of a divergent series should not be possible in a way that leads to convergence, and the behavior of continuous functions concerning closed and bounded sets seems too general to be applicable in this context.\n\n## Paragraph 5: Grand Conclusion\n\nThe given statements appear to be incompatible with each other. Either one of them is false, or there exists a deeper mathematical nuance that allows for their apparent contradiction. Further analysis and context-specific assumptions are required to determine the true relationship between these two statements."}

Highlight the final answer (and the final answer only) in bold. Your entire response should be in English, and in all lowercase letters. No capital letters are allowed.", "response": "There are 10 professors and 20 courses, and each professor needs to be assigned to teach exactly 2 courses while each course needs exactly one professor assigned. \n\nWe can solve this by first choosing the 2 courses for each professor from the 20 courses, which can be done in 20C2 ways. \n\nThen, we need to assign the remaining 8 courses to the remaining 8 professors. This can be done in 8! ways. \n\nTherefore, there are **20C2 * 8!** different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses."}
