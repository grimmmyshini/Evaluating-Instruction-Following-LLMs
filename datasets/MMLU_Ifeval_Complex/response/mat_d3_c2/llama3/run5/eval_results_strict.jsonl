Let's break it down step by step.\n\nWhen A and B divide the segment into three smaller segments, we can label them as AB, BC, and CA (see the diagram below).\n\nIf the three smaller segments are to form the sides of a triangle, we need to satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of any two side lengths must be greater than the third side length.\n\nSince AB + BC > CA, this condition is equivalent to saying that A and B are closer together than point C. Similarly, for BC + CA > AB, we require that B and C are closer together than point A, and finally, for CA + AB > BC, we need A and C to be closer together than point B.\n\nNow, let's consider the probability that these conditions are met. We can think of it as a Bernoulli trial with three possible outcomes: either A is between B and C (ABC), or B is between A and C (BCA), or C is between A and B (CAB).\n\nLet p be the probability that a random point lies between two fixed points.

Since the zero matrix has only one element equal to 1 and all others equal to zero, dim(U) + dim(W) = n^2. Thus, II is TRUE.\n\n\\n\\n\nFor III: Clearly U cannot contain more than n matrices because T maps each eigenvector to a scalar multiple of itself, which means there can be at most n linearly independent elements in XT. Therefore, we have that dim(U) \u2264 n and since U \u2260 {0} we have dim(U) < n.\n\n\\n\\n\nTree: The dimensions of the subspaces are related by the following equation:\n\ndim(U) + dim(W) = dim(M(V)) \n\nSince TX \u2212 XT is an invertible linear transformation (the determinant is 1), W is a subspace of M(V).

To do this, we need to find k! when it ends with 100.\n\nLet's consider the number 5!. 5! = 120, which does not have any trailing zeroes. If we go up one more notch to 6!, we get 720, which still doesn't end with any trailing zeros. It takes us until 10! = 3628800 (which has exactly two trailing zeros) before we start getting zeros at the end.\n\nSo now we know that for every integer k, there is an integer p such that p! has at least one less zero than k!, but the difference between p! and q! is equal to a number with no trailing zeroes. Hence, we need to find when this number becomes 10^99.\n\nSECTION 2\nLet's define n = (p+1)!. Since n and q! differ by exactly one number with no trailing zeros, it follows that the difference between n and q! is less than or equal to 10^98. This is because each integer from p! to n-1 has at most 98 zeros in base 10.\n\nNow, let's consider the function f(x) = log(10)x. Since (p+1)! grows very rapidly, there must be an x such that f(x) is less than or equal to 2*10^98 (where log is taken base 10).\n\nThis inequality holds when x = 28.\n\nSECTION 3\nSo now we know the value of p which gives us a number with at least 99 trailing zeros. This means all integers k such that k! > 5.4 * 10^26 have exactly 99 trailing zeros in their decimal representation.\n\nTherefore, **there are 43 positive integers k for which the ordinary decimal representation of the integer k! ends in exactly 99 zeros**."}

The identity permutation, also known as the \"do-nothing\" permutation, leaves every object in its original position.\n\nFor example, if we are looking at a permutation where the first object is swapped with the second one, then the third with the fourth, etc., then after 5 such swaps, all objects will return to their original positions (because everything has been swapped back). So this particular permutation has an order of 5. In general, any permutation that consists of consecutive swaps between pairs of adjacent objects has an order equal to the number of objects.\n\n**Section 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum possible order is achieved when every object is swapped with each other. This can be done by first swapping the first two, then the second and third, and so on. In this way, we make all objects swap places in a single cycle (5 objects). Therefore, the largest possible order is 5!\n\n**Final Answer:**\n**5!**"}

We have two choices for which of these three becomes the next vertex in the Pr\u00fcfer sequence.\n\nSection 3\nBy the time we've chosen this third vertex, we only have one leaf left (the root of a single-edge tree).
