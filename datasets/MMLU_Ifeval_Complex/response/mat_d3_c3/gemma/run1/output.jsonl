{"prompt": "A university\u2019s mathematics department has 10 professors and will offer 20 different courses next semester. Each professor will be assigned to teach exactly 2 of the courses, and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it. If any professor can be assigned to teach any course, how many different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses are possible?  Highlight the final answer (and the final answer only) in bold. Your entire response should be in English, and in all lowercase letters. No capital letters are allowed.
