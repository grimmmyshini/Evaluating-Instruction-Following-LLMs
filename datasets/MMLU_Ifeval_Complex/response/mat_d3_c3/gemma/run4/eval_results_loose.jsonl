This is a fundamental result in analysis and can be proven using various methods, such as the epsilon-delta definition of continuity and the uniform continuity theorem.\n\n**STATEMENT 2:**\n\n* The statement is false. A counterexample can be found by considering the function f(x) = sin(1/x) for x \u2260 0 and f(0) = 0. This function is differentiable everywhere, but the composition f(g(x)) is not differentiable at x = 0 for any differentiable function g(x)."}
