Our goal is to maximize the number of acute angles in a 10-gon. However, there's redundancy in the way we can define acute angles in a polygon. If we can remove these redundancies, we can effectively count the remaining unique acute angles.\n\n**Section 1**\n\nThe key observation is that in a convex polygon, any adjacent pair of angles can only be either both acute or both obtuse (greater than 180 degrees). This redundancy can be removed by considering only the interior angles that are less than 180 degrees.\n\n**Section 2**\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef func46(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return 0\n    return (n-2)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function takes one argument, n, which represents the number of sides in the polygon.\n- If the polygon has 3 or fewer sides, it cannot have any acute angles, so the function returns 0.\n- Otherwise, the function uses the formula (n-2) to calculate the total number of interior angles of a convex polygon. \n- Each interior angle of a convex polygon is less than 180 degrees, so all of them are acute.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon is **8**."}
