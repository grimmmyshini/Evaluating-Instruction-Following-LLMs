Mark the beginning of each section with Section X, such as:\nSection 1\n[content of section 1]\nSection 2\n[content of section 2]", "response": "## Section 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nThe given parametric equations define a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. We need to find the length of the curve traced by these equations.\n\n## Section 2: Implementing Parametric Differentiation\n\nTo find the arc length, we need to differentiate the parametric equations:\n\n$$x' = - \\sin t \\quad; \\quad y' = \\cos t$$\n\nThen, apply the formula for the arc length of a parametric curve:\n\n$$L = \\int_0^\\pi \\sqrt{x'^2 + y'^2} \\ dt$$\n\n## Section 3: Evaluation of the Integral\n\n$$L = \\int_0^\\pi \\sqrt{(-\\sin t)^2 + (\\cos t)^2} \\ dt = \\int_0^\\pi 1 \\ dt = \\pi$$\n\nTherefore, the length of the curve is **pi**.\n\n## Section 4: Python Function\n\n```python\ndef func13():\n    import math\n\n    t = math.linspace(0, math.pi, 100)\n    x = math.cos(t)\n    y = math.sin(t)\n\n    arc_length = sum(math.sqrt(x[i]**2 + y[i]**2) for i in range(len(t)))\n\n    return arc_length\n```\n\nThis function uses NumPy library in Python to efficiently calculate the arc length of the given curve."}

{"prompt": "A university\u2019s mathematics department has 10 professors and will offer 20 different courses next semester. Each professor will be assigned to teach exactly 2 of the courses, and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it. If any professor can be assigned to teach any course, how many different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses are possible?  Highlight the final answer (and the final answer only) in bold. Your entire response should be in English, and in all lowercase letters. No capital letters are allowed. In your entire response, refrain from the use of any commas. Along with providing an answer to the question, give the mathematical equation that solves this problem. Wrap this (and only this) equation in a box. Use Latex style formatting to format the math equation.", "response": "There are 10 professors and 20 courses, and each professor needs to teach exactly 2 courses and each course needs to have exactly one professor assigned to teach it.
