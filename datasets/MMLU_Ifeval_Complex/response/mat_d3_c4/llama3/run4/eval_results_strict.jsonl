Since H contains the additive identity e, we have y + (3y) = e as the only possibility for y in H.\n\n**Step 3:** Now, let z be any element in G. Then there exists an integer k such that 4z = ky. We can write this as z = (1/4)ky or equivalently z = (1/4)y(4k). Since y is the smallest possible positive multiple of itself satisfying 4y = 0, we have z in H if and only if k is even.\n\n**Step 4:** Therefore, G splits into two cosets: H consisting of all multiples of y with even multiplicity, and its complement consisting of multiples of y with odd multiplicity.

This is a total of 5 elements in H plus the coset K which contains all multiples of y with odd multiplicity. Since |G| = 16, it follows that |K| = 15.\n\nOn the other hand if p = 3 then G has exactly three elements y satisfying 4y = 0 and therefore three cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by these y's. This is a total of 7 elements in H plus K which contains all multiples of y with odd multiplicity. Again since |G| = 16, it follows that |K| = 15.\n\n**Answer:** Therefore up to isomorphism there are two additive abelian groups G of order 16 satisfying x + x + x + x = 0 for each x in G namely when p = 1 and when p = 3."}

Also, since U is the set of matrices that commute with T, we know that if X is in U then TX = XT. This implies that W \u2286 U because TX - XT is a matrix that commutes with T as well.\n\n\nLet's prove I. Suppose V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T. Then for any X \u2208 M(V), there exists some scalar \u03bb such that TX = \u03bbX. If X is in this basis, then TX = XT and thus XT = \u03bbX. This implies that XT - TX = (\u03bb-1)X which means XT - TX is a multiple of the eigenvectors of T. Since V has finite dimension, it cannot have an infinite number of linearly independent eigenvectors, so we must conclude that X - X = 0. Thus U = M(V). This proves I.\n\n\nSection 2\n\n\nLet's prove II. Recall that U and W are subspaces of M(V) and thus they satisfy the subspace properties: closure under addition, closure under scalar multiplication, and containing the zero vector. Since T is linear, TX - XT is in W for any X \u2208 M(V). Now if Y is in U then TY = YT which implies that YT - YT = 0 is in W. This means W contains all matrices of the form YT - YT where Y is in U. But this implies that dim(W) \u2265 dim(U). On the other hand, since U \u2286 W by definition, we have dim(U) \u2264 dim(W). Thus we conclude that dim(U) = dim(W) because both are less than or equal to n^2. This proves II.\n\n\nSection 3\n\n\nLet's prove III. Since V has finite dimension n and M(V) has n^2 dimensions, it must be possible to find a basis of M(V) with n^2 linearly independent matrices. Now let Y1, ..., Yin^2 be such a basis and let X be any matrix in U. Then TX - XT is in W. Since T is linear, we can write TX - XT as a linear combination of Y1, ..., Yin^2 say that it's the sum of some coefficients times these matrices: c1Y1 + ... + cn^2In^2 where ci are scalars. But then X - X = 0 must be in U and thus this equation can also be written as some combination of Y1, ..., Yin^2. However, since X is arbitrary, this means that the coefficients ci must all be zero because there's no way to write a general matrix as a linear combination of only n-1 matrices (n^2 - n = n(n-1)). Thus we have dim(U) \u2264 n-1 which proves III."}

Since the smallest multiple of 5 greater than 576 is 600, we can conclude that the value of k for which the decimal representation of k! ends with exactly 99 zeros must be less than or equal to 599.\n\nSECTION 3: THE FINALE\n\nTo find all possible values of k, we need to count the number of multiples of 5 that are less than or equal to 599. Since there are 120 such multiples (0, 5, 10, ..., 595), and each multiple of 5 has a corresponding multiple of 25 (which adds an additional zero to the decimal representation of k!), we can conclude that there are at most 60 values of k for which the decimal representation of k! ends with exactly 99 zeros.\n\nTherefore, **the answer is 60**."}

Since this altitude intersects with the opposite side of the triangle at its midpoint, this creates a smaller right triangle. The Pythagorean theorem gives us the length of the hypotenuse in terms of the radius and the height: \u221a(1^2 + (1/2)^2). Setting this equal to 1 gives us an equation for the base: 2\u221a3 - 1.\n\nThis is where the magic happens. As we move our second vertex along the circle, the triangle gets bigger and bigger until it becomes equilateral. The area of an equilateral triangle is given by (\u221a3/4) times side squared. In this case, that would be (\u221a3/4)(2\u221a3 - 1)^2.\n\nCross now, we can compute the maximum area: (\u221a3/4)((2\u221a3 - 1)^2).
