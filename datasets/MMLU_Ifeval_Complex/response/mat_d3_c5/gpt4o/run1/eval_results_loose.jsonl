An inscribed circle (incircle) in an equilateral triangle touches the midpoint of each side. This radius is also known as the inradius. The relationship between the side length \\( a \\) of an equilateral triangle and its inradius \\( r \\) is given by the formula: \\( r = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{6} \\).\n\n***\nSection 2\nGiven the inradius \\( r = 2 \\), we can set up the equation \\( 2 = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{6} \\). To solve for \\( a \\), multiply both sides by 6: \\( 6 \\cdot 2 = a\\sqrt{3} \\), which simplifies to \\( 12 = a\\sqrt{3} \\). Next, solving for \\( a \\), divide both sides by \\( \\sqrt{3} \\): \\( a = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}} \\), further simplifying to \\( a = 4\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\n***\nSection 3\nWith the side length \\( a = 4\\sqrt{3} \\) determined, we can now find the area of the equilateral triangle. The formula for the area \\( A \\) of an equilateral triangle based on its side length \\( a \\) is: \\( A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 \\). Substituting \\( a = 4\\sqrt{3} \\) into this formula, we calculate: \\( A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (4\\sqrt{3})^2 \\).\n\n***\nSection 4\nSimplifying this, we get \\( A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot 48 \\).

This demonstrates the clear resolution of the problem, ensuring precise contract of our mathematical approach with geometric principles.\n\n***\nSection 5\nHere is a Python implementation of the function named `func2` that computes the area of an equilateral triangle given the inradius:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef func2(radius):\n    # Given inradius\n    r = radius\n    # Side length calculation\n    a = (r * 6) / math.sqrt(3)\n    # Area calculation\n    area = (math.sqrt(3) / 4) * (a ** 2)\n    return area\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = func2(2)\nprint(result) # Output will be 12 * sqrt(3)\n```\n\nThis `func2` function adheres to the principles expressed earlier, allowing for seamless and accurate computational contract of the problem resolution."}

Creating teams where no student is the teammate of someone they dislike leads to a problem that can be visualized as partitioning a graph so that no directed edge lies within any partition.

The given circle has a radius of 1 unit. The triangle in question will be an isosceles triangle since the two sides from the center to the circumference are radii and thus equal.\n\n**Step 1:** Consider the formula for the area of a triangle with base \\( b \\) and height \\( h \\): \n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times b \\times h \\]\n\nHere, however, the triangle will have vertices at (0,0) (center of the circle) and at some points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on the circumference of the circle.\n\n**Step 2:** The maximum area can be observed when the angle subtended by the arc between the two points on the circumference is 180 degrees, making the triangle a right-angled triangle with the line segment between the two points on the circumference being the hypotenuse.\n\n**Step 3:** In a circle with radius 1, the maximum base (the chord between two points) is actually the diameter, which is 2 units, and the height in such a configuration would be 1 unit (the radius). So, \n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 1 = 1 \\]\n\n**Step 4:** Cross-verifying, we realize that any reduction in the angle would decrease the effective base of the triangle within the circle and thus reduce its area. Therefore, the maximum area indeed aligns with the right-angled triangle configuration where the chord forms the circle's diameter.\n\nThus, the greatest possible area of the triangular region with one vertex at the center and base being the diameter is 1 square unit.\n\nBelow is the Python function named `func21` to compute this:\n\n```python\ndef func21():\n    # Given radius of the circle\n    radius = 1\n    \n    # Length of the base (diameter) of the triangle\n    base = 2 * radius\n    \n    # Height of the triangle (which is the radius of the circle)\n    height = radius\n    \n    # Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula (1/2 * base * height)\n    area = 0.5 * base * height\n    \n    return area\n\n# Testing the function\nprint(func21())  # Output should be 1.0\n```\n\nThis script correctly calculates the greatest possible area of 1 square unit by setting the vertex at the center of the circle and utilizing the circle\u2019s diameter as the base of the triangle."}

To solve the problem, we need to recognize that linear transformations can be expressed in the form \\( f(x, y) = ax + by \\) for some constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). By using the provided information, \\( f(1, 1) = 1 \\) and \\( f(-1, 0) = 2 \\), we can set up a system of equations to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Specifically, the equations are \\( a + b = 1 \\) and \\( -a = 2 \\). Solving these equations, we find \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\). Thus, the linear transformation is \\( f(x, y) = -2x + 3y \\). To find \\( f(3, 5) \\), we substitute \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = 5 \\) into this transformation, yielding \\( f(3, 5) = -2(3) + 3(5) = -6 + 15 = 9 \\).\n\nConsidering the implementation, we can create a Python function that takes the input values and calculates the result accordingly. The function will be named `func55` and will perform these calculations systematically. Here's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef func55(x, y):\n    # Constants derived from the equations using the given points f(1, 1) = 1 and f(-1, 0) = 2\n    a = -2\n    b = 3\n    # Linear transformation f(x, y) = ax + by\n    return a * x + b * y\n\n# Example usage to find f(3, 5)\nresult = func55(3, 5)\nprint(result)  # Output should be 9\n```\n\nIn conclusion, linear transformations, once understood, can be manipulated with ease. With the knowledge of constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), we've implemented the `func55` function, verifying that \\( f(3, 5) = 9 \\). This approach can be analogously applied to varied planar to real-number transformations. Understanding these linearities is like having a bowl of rich information mixed with a methodological dad-like guidance, ensuring each transformation question yields the correct result computationally."}

For a given plane equation \\(2x + y + 3z = 3\\), we first need to determine the point that satisfies this plane equation and simultaneously minimizes the distance to the origin. The plane's normal vector is \\(\\mathbf{N} = [2, 1, 3]\\). The closest point on the plane to the origin will lie along this normal vector. This is because any other point would result in a larger perpendicular (Euclidean) distance. By projecting the origin onto the plane along this normal line, we can solve for the intersection point.\n\nThe point on the plane can be found using the projection formula which involves dot products and vector arithmetic. Specifically, if we let \\(\\mathbf{P} = (x, y, z)\\) be a point on the plane, then \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) can be expressed as \\(d \\cdot \\mathbf{N}\\) for some scalar \\(d\\). The plane equation becomes \\(\\mathbf{N} \\cdot (d \\cdot \\mathbf{N}) = 3\\). Solving for \\(d\\) gives us the required distance along the normal vector to the closest point on the plane. Finally, by substituting back to get the coordinates (x, y, z), we find our desired point.\n\nSwitch to the implementation part, let's use Python to visualize and confirm this analytical finding. Here is the function named `func92`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef func92():\n    N = np.array([2, 1, 3])\n    d = 3 / np.dot(N, N)  # solving for d using the dot product\n    closest_point = d * N\n    return tuple(closest_point)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(f\"The coordinates of the closest point on the plane to the origin are {func92()}\")\n```\n\nUpon executing this function, you will find the closest point's coordinates. When you run this Python code, the coordinates printed should match our analytical solution. Highlighting the final answer, **(0.4, 0.2, 0.6)**, is the closest point on the plane \\(2x + y + 3z = 3\\) to the origin. This result confirms both our geometric intuition and solution through projection and optimization approaches.\n\nKeywords: ['boot', 'serve']."}

However, there are some analytical techniques we can use to gain insights into the behavior of the polynomial. First, let's analyze its overall structure: it's a fifth-degree polynomial, which means it has up to five roots in total. Due to the Intermediate Value Theorem, we may find spots where the polynomial transitions from positive to negative values, indicating the presence of a real root.\n\nTo proceed, we can apply Descartes' Rule of Signs to get an idea of the number of positive and negative real roots for the polynomial \\(2x^5 + 8x - 7 = 0\\). For positive roots, we look at the number of sign changes in the polynomial as given. In the polynomial \\(2x^5 + 8x - 7\\), the signs change from \\(+\\) to \\(-\\), indicating one possible positive root. Next, we substitute \\(x\\) with \\(-x\\) to determine the number of negative roots. Substituting, we get \\(-2x^5 - 8x - 7\\), which does not introduce any further sign changes, suggesting no negative roots. Thus, we can infer that there is likely a single real root in the positive range.\n\nAdditionally, it's beneficial to look at the derivative of the polynomial to understand its critical points. The first derivative is \\(10x^4 + 8\\), which is always positive for all real values of \\(x\\). This implies that the function is monotonically increasing. Because a continuously increasing function can have at most one transition from negative to positive, we can confirm that there is exactly one real root.\n\nBunch these observations together, and we see that the polynomial \\(2x^5 + 8x - 7\\) indeed has a single real root. Wrapping all the equations into a mathematical expression to summarize:\n\n\\[\n2x^5 + 8x - 7 = 0\n\\]\n\nBy differentiating \\(10x^4 + 8\\), we ascertain that the function consistently increases, leading us to conclude there's precisely one real root, providing a sense of relief when checking our analytical approach against our initial findings.\""}

If \\(\\sum |a_i|\\) diverges and \\(\\sum a_i = 2\\), it means the series \\(\\sum a_i\\) is conditionally convergent. According to the Riemann rearrangement theorem, any conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to converge to any given value, or even made to diverge. Therefore, it is possible to rearrange \\(a_i\\) in such a way as to make \\(\\sum a_i_k = 4\\).\n\nA good way to understand such manipulations is through understanding the calculus of series and their properties. Conditionally convergent series exhibit a unique flexibility due to the delicate balance between the positive and negative terms. By reordering these terms strategically, one can make the partial sums approach any desired value. This hallmark of the Riemann rearrangement theorem serves as an elegant example of the interplay between order and summation in convergent series.\n\nOn the other hand, absolutely convergent series do not possess such mutability. If \\(\\sum |a_i|\\) converges, then any rearrangement will still converge to the same sum. This distinction helps underline the more predictable behavior of absolutely convergent series compared to conditionally convergent series. Thus, in the context of Statement 1, the importance of the divergence of \\(\\sum |a_i|\\) is profound, defining the inherent nature of the series as one capable of being rearranged to achieve different sums.\n\nSection 2\n\nStatement 2 involves metric spaces and can be analyzed using fundamental properties of continuity and topological structures. Consider metric spaces \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) where \\(X\\) is closed and bounded. The definition of a continuous mapping \\(f: X \\rightarrow Y\\) means that the inverse image of any open set in \\(Y\\) is an open set in \\(X\\). However, continuity does not inherently preserve the closed and bounded nature from \\(X\\) onto \\(Y\\). \n\nFor example, let \\(X\\) be the closed interval \\([0,1]\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(Y\\) be \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Define \\(f(x) = \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}x\\right)\\). The mapping \\(f\\) is continuous on \\(X\\), but its image \\(f(X) = (-\\infty, \\infty)\\) is not bounded and is not closed. This example underpins the fact that continuous functions can indeed map closed and bounded sets to sets that are not closed and not bounded, challenging any initial assumptions to the contrary.\n\nGrand assumptions on the nature of closed and bounded sets often need careful consideration, particularly in diverse metric spaces. This demonstrates the nuanced nature of function mappings between different topological spaces, reflecting the hallmarks of complex mathematical relationships under continuous transformations.\""}

We get:\n\\[ (-\\sin t)^2 = \\sin^2 t \\]\n\\[ (\\cos t)^2 = \\cos^2 t \\]\n\n**Step 6:** Therefore:\n\\[ \\sqrt{(\\sin t)^2 + (\\cos t)^2} = \\sqrt{\\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t} \\]\n\n**Step 7:** Using the Pythagorean identity \\( \\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t = 1 \\), we further simplify the integral:\n\\[ L = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sqrt{1} \\, dt \\]\n\\[ L = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} 1 \\, dt \\]\n\n**Step 8:** Now evaluate the integral:\n\\[ L = t \\Big|_{0}^{\\pi} = \\pi - 0 = \\pi \\]\n\nSection 3\n\n**Step 9:** The length of the curve from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = \\pi \\) is \\( \\pi \\).\n\n**Step 10:** Next, implement a Python function named **func13** that calculates the length of the curve:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef func13():\n    # Define the integrand function\n    integrand = lambda t: np.sqrt((-np.sin(t))**2 + (np.cos(t))**2)\n    \n    # Compute the integral\n    length, error = quad(integrand, 0, np.pi)\n    \n    # Return the length of the curve\n    return length\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(func13())  # Expected output: 3.141592653589793\n```\n\nSection 4\n\n**Step 11:** We defined the integrand and used the **quad** function from **scipy** to integrate it. The integrand simplifies to \\( 1 \\) because of the Pythagorean identity.\n\n**Step 12:** The quad function provides an easy way to EVALUATE the definite integral. The Python code above IMPLEMENTS this solution EFFECTIVELY.\n\n**Step 13:** Finally, calling **func13** returns the LENGTH of the curve, \\( \\pi \\), which is approximately 3.141592653589793.\n\n**Step 14:** This step-by-step guide PROVIDES clarity on approaching problems related to ARC length of PARAMETRIC curves. Additionally, Python IMPLEMENTATION offers a convenient METHOD for automated calculation.\n\nStar by FOLLOWING the above steps CAREFULLY to gain deep UNDERSTANDING of ARC length calculations. The python FUNCTION also ensures ACCURACY and saves time in manual integration."}
