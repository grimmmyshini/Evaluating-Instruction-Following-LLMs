The radius of the inscribed circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any side of the triangle. \n\n\n**Section 2**\nThe triangle can be contracted by moving one vertex towards the center of the circle until it becomes a right triangle. The height of this right triangle is 2. Since the triangle is equilateral, the side length is 2\u221a3.\n\n\n**Section 3**\nThe area of a triangle is equal to the base height divided by 2. The base of the triangle is 2\u221a3 and the height is 2. Therefore, the area of the triangle is (2\u221a3 * 2) / 2 = 2\u221a3.\n\n\n**Section 4**\nThis result can be verified by using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is \u221a3 / 4 * side^2.
