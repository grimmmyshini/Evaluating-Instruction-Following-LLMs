The center of the inscribed circle, also known as the incenter, is the same as the centroid of the equilateral triangle. For an equilateral triangle, the radius of the inscribed circle \\( r \\) is related to the side length \\( s \\) through the formula \\( r = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6} \\). Given that the radius \\( r \\) is 2, we can find the side length \\( s \\).\n\n***\n\nSection 2\n\nFirst, let's isolate \\( s \\) in terms of \\( r \\). The formula provided is \\( r = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6} \\). With \\( r = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ 2 = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6:\n\n\\[ 12 = s \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( \\sqrt{3} \\):\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}} \\]\n\n***\n\nSection 3\n\nSimplifying \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = 4 \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nNext, we'll use the side length \\( s \\) to find the area \\( A \\) of the equilateral triangle. The area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\]\n\n***\n\nSection 4\n\nSubstituting \\( s = 4 \\sqrt{3} \\):\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{(4 \\sqrt{3})^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{16 \\times 3 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ A = 12 \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the equilateral triangle, given that the inscribed circle has a radius of 2, is \\( 12 \\sqrt{3} \\). \n\nFor a more computational approach, we can create a Python function named `func2` that performs these steps.\n\n***\n\nSection 5\n\nHere is a Python function that computes the area of an equilateral triangle with a given inscribed circle radius:\n\n```python\ndef func2(radius):\n    # Calculate the side length s from the radius\n    s = 6 * radius / (3 ** 0.5)\n    # Calculate the area A of the equilateral triangle\n    A = (s ** 2 * (3 ** 0.5)) / 4\n    return A\n\n# Example usage:\narea = func2(2)\nprint(f\"The area of the equilateral triangle is: {area} square units\")\n```\n\nThis function, `func2`, efficiently resolves the problem by converting the radius of the inscribed circle into the side length of the triangle and subsequently calculating the area. Implementing such precise calculations and the final resolution in Python ensures reliable and error-free results, making it ideal for contract-based geometrical mathematics."}

This means every element in \\(G\\) has an order that divides \\(4\\). Consequently, the group can be expressed as a direct sum of cyclic groups whose orders also divide \\(4\\). Therefore, \\(G\\) is a direct sum of copies of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4\\) or \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\).\n\n**Step 2:** We consider the combinations of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) that result in a group of order \\(16\\). Since the total order is \\(16\\), possible combinations can be investigated. Write \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}_{4}^{a} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{b}\\) such that \\( |G| = 4^a \\cdot 2^b \\) with \\( 4^a \\cdot 2^b = 16 \\).\n\nSECTION 2\n\n**Step 3:** Evaluate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to fit the order \\(16\\). Starting with \\(4^a\\), let \\(a = 0\\), then we need \\(2^b = 16\\) yielding \\(b = 4\\) providing \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}_2^{4}\\). Next, when \\(a = 1\\), then \\(4^a = 4\\) and hence \\(2^b = 4\\), resulting in \\(b = 2\\) and thereby \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2^{2}\\).\n\n**Step 4:** Consider any larger \\(a\\). Set \\(a = 2\\), thus \\(4^a = 16\\) and \\(2^b = 1\\) implying \\(b = 0\\), so \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}_4^{2}\\). Note that these combinations exhaust the divides while maintaining the group's properties.\n\n**Step 5:** In conclusion, we have found the frames satisfying \\(x + x + x + x = 0\\) yielding three groups: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2^4, \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2^2\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4^2\\).

Let's break this down systematically. \n\nFirst, **Step 1:** identify the total possible combinations for selecting 3 suitcases out of 25. This can be computed using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [(n-k)! k!], where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 25 and k = 3. Hence, C(25, 3) = 25! / (22! 3!) = 2300 combinations.\n\n***\n\nSection 2\n\nNext, **Step 2:** determine how many ways we can choose exactly 2 damaged suitcases from the 5 that are damaged. This is done using the combination formula again, where n = 5 and k = 2, so C(5, 2) = 5! / (3! 2!) = 10 ways.\n\nThen, **Step 3:** for the remaining suitcase among the 3, it must be from the non-damaged ones. There are 20 non-damaged suitcases (25 total minus 5 damaged). So, we need to choose 1 out of these 20: C(20, 1) = 20 ways.\n\n***\n\nSection 3\n\nPutting it all together, **Step 4:** compute the number of favorable outcomes by multiplying the two combinations calculated in Section 2. That is, 10 ways to choose the damaged suitcases multiplied by 20 ways to choose the non-damaged one, resulting in 10 * 20 = 200 favorable outcomes. \n\nFinally, **Step 5:** find the probability by dividing the favorable outcomes by the total possible combinations. The probability is 200 (favorable outcomes) / 2300 (total combinations) = 0.0869565, which is approximately 8.7%.

Suppose each student dislikes three classmates. This problem can be visualized as a graph, where each student is a vertex, and an edge exists between vertices if one student dislikes another. The challenge then becomes finding an optimal way to partition this graph into the smallest number of subsets, where there are no edges within any subset \u2014 this is known as finding the minimum number of colors required for a graph coloring of a graph with maximum degree 3. According to graph theory, a simple and straightforward debate suggests that a graph with a maximum degree of 3 can always be colored using 4 colors. Hence, in this scenario, each team can be assigned a unique color, ensuring no student shares a team with someone they dislike.\n\nAfter a rigorous debate among mathematicians and graph theorists, it's agreed that using 4 different teams is the most efficient way to ensure no two students who dislike each other are placed on the same team. This conclusion rests on several foundational principles from both graph theory and combinatorics. When dividing the class, it\u2019s paramount to ensure students are grouped in such a way that the social dynamics and preferences are respected, given their importance in maintaining harmony and productivity within the teams. Therefore, the minimum number of teams required is **4**.\n\nAny other questions?"}
