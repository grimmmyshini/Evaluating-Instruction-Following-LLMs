An injective linear transformation from a space of the same dimension onto itself is bijective. \n\n**Python Function:**\n\n```python\ndef func72(dim_v):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a linear transformation is injective based on the dimensions of the spaces.\n\n    Args:\n        dim_v (int): The dimension of the domain space.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the transformation is injective, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if dim_v == 0:\n        return True  # Trivial case\n    return dim_v < 2\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The `func72` function takes the dimension of the domain space as input.\n* It handles the trivial case of a space of dimension 0 (which is always injective).\n* Otherwise, it checks if the dimension is less than 2. If so, the transformation is injective by definition.\n* The function returns `True` or `False` based on the result of the checks."}

While their kernels play a pivotal role in understanding the structure of the domain, an empty kernel signifies a special kind of homomorphism. Additionally, restrictions on the domain and codomain can significantly influence the existence of non-trivial homomorphisms.\n\n**Statement 1: Empty Kernel**\n\nA homomorphism may have an empty kernel. This means that the homomorphism maps every element of the domain to the identity element of the codomain. Such a homomorphism effectively \"ignores\" the underlying algebraic structure of the domain.\n\n**Protection**\n\nAn empty kernel doesn't necessarily imply a trivial homomorphism. The homomorphism may still exhibit interesting properties despite mapping all elements of the domain to the identity.\n\n**Statement 2: Finite to Infinite**\n\nIt is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group. This is because a nontrivial homomorphism would require the pre-image of the identity element in the infinite group to contain at least two elements. However, a finite group can only have a finite number of elements, making such a pre-image impossible.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe interplay between empty kernels and the relationship between finite and infinite groups sheds light on the limitations and possibilities of homomorphisms. Understanding these concepts is vital for navigating the intricate landscape of abstract algebra."}
