{"prompt": "Determine whether the polynomial in Z[x] satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q. x^2 - 12  Include keywords ['strength', 'you'] in the response. Highlight the final answer (and the final answer only) in bold.", "response": "**The polynomial x^2 - 12 does not satisfy an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q.**\n\n**Reason:** The strength of the Eisenstein criterion is 2, which means that we need to check if there exists a non-zero polynomial f in Q[x] of degree less than 2 such that f^2 divides x^2 - 12. However, it is easy to see that such a polynomial does exist (e.g., f = x - 2). Therefore, the given polynomial does not satisfy an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q."}

They map elements of one group to another, preserving the group structure. The kernel of a homomorphism is a crucial notion that measures the extent to which the homomorphism fails to be an isomorphism.\n\n**Statement 1:**\n\nA homomorphism may have an empty kernel. This means the homomorphism is injective, and every element in the domain is mapped to a unique element in the range. An empty kernel implies that the homomorphism is a monomorphism, preserving the group structure.\n\n**Protection:**\n\nThe statement emphasizes that an empty kernel is not a necessary condition for a homomorphism. Non-empty kernels simply mean the homomorphism is not injective, allowing multiple elements in the domain to map to the same element in the range.\n\n**Statement 2:**\n\nIt is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe fundamental theorem of homomorphism states that every homomorphism between finite and infinite groups is automatically trivial. This means the homomorphism must be constant, sending all elements of the finite group to the same element in the infinite group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe interplay between homomorphisms and their kernels plays a vital role in group theory. Understanding these concepts allows mathematicians to unravel intricate algebraic structures and establish profound connections between different groups."}
