Here, the whole part is '5' and the decimal part is '.875'. Converting this decimal component into a fraction will help in seamlessly putting together the whole number and the fraction as a mixed number.\n\nSECTION 2\nConverting the Decimal Part to a Fraction\nTo convert the decimal 0.875 into a fraction, we look at it as 875 thousandths, or \\(0.875 = \\frac{875}{1000}\\). Our next step is to simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\nSECTION 3\nSimplifying the Fraction\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{875}{1000}\\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 875 and 1000. We notice that both numbers end in 25, so they are both divisible by 25. Dividing both by 25, we have:\nNumerator: \\(875 \u00f7 25 = 35\\)\nDenominator: \\(1000 \u00f7 25 = 40\\)\nThus, \\( \\frac{875}{1000} = \\frac{35}{40}\\).\nFurther simplification, recognizing that 35 and 40 are both divisible by 5 gives:\nNumerator: \\(35 \u00f7 5 = 7\\)\nDenominator: \\(40 \u00f7 5 = 8\\)\nResulting in \\( \\frac{35}{40} = \\frac{7}{8}\\).\n\nSECTION 4\nForming the Mixed Number\nHaving reduced the fraction \\(0.875\\) to \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) and knowing the whole number part is 5, we can now combine these into a mixed number. The mixed number comprising a whole number and a fraction is written as the whole number followed by the fraction.

To solve this, we need to understand the concept of a proportion, which is an equation that states that two ratios are equivalent. Basically, if a/b = c/d, then ad should equal bc.\n\nSECTION 2\nFirst, let's represent the unknown number as 'x' so that we can say the proportion is written as \\( \\frac{48}{88} = \\frac{x}{11} \\). To solve for 'x', we use the property of cross-multiplication, which states that in a proportion, the product of the extremes (first term from the first ratio and the second term from the second ratio) equals the product of the means (the second term from the first ratio and the first term from the second ratio).\n\nSECTION 3\nApplying cross-multiplication to our given proportion, we multiply 48 (from the left ratio) by 11 (from the right ratio), and we multiply 88 (from the left ratio) by 'x' (from the right ratio). Therefore, the equation now looks like: \\( 48 \\times 11 = 88 \\times x \\).\n\nSECTION 4\nBy solving this equation, we get: \\( 528 = 88x \\).

This solution made use of proportional reasoning and algebraic manipulation, useful tools in dealing with ratios and proportions in mathematics.

No other words should follow this phrase.", "decomposed_questions": ["Does the response contain at least 15 sentences'?", "Does the response end with: 'Any other questions?'?"], "subset": "", "question_label": [["Length"], ["Content"]], "difficulty": 1, "output": "Understanding how map scales work is essential for accurately interpreting distances on a map. A map scale typically represents the relationship between a distance on the map and the actual distance on the ground. In this instance, the map scale is provided as 1 inch equals 25 miles. This scale means that one inch of the map corresponds to a real-world distance of 25 miles.\n\nLet's break down how we use this scale to calculate the distance represented by a longer measure on the map, for example, 5 inches. To start, we know from the scale that each inch on the map equals 25 miles. Now to find out how many miles 5 inches represent, we multiply the number of inches by the number of miles that each inch stands for.\n\nHere is the calculation process step-by-step:\n1. Start with the given map scale: 1 inch = 25 miles.\n2. You need to find the distance represented by 5 inches.\n3. Use multiplication to scale up the distance: 5 inches \u00d7 25 miles/inch.\n\nThis calculation is:\n5 inches \u00d7 25 miles/inch = 125 miles.\n\nTherefore, 5 inches on the map equals 125 miles in reality. This simple multiplication has provided us with the actual distance, demonstrating that map scales are a valuable tool for converting map measurements into practical, real-world distances.\n\nUnderstanding and using map scales correctly is crucial, whether you are planning a trip, studying geography, or engaging in professional fields such as urban planning or landscaping. Proper interpretation of map scales can help in efficient planning and resource management, travel timing, and logistics.\n\nThis conversion is crucial, especially in contexts where precision is necessary. For example, knowing exact distances allows better time management when traveling between places. Additionally, in professions relying upon precise spatial analysis, understanding such distance conversions is essential for planning and executing tasks effectively.\n\nNow, let's recap what has been covered:\n- A map scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles was given.\n- You needed to find the actual global distance represented by 5 inches on the map.\n- Multiplying 5 inches by 25 miles per inch provided the distance of 125 miles.\n\nYou now know that using a scale to convert measurements on a map to actual distances is a straightforward multiplication process. Mastering this technique will improve your ability to interpret maps accurately and use them effectively in a variety of scenarios.\n\nAny other questions?", "eval": [true, true]}
