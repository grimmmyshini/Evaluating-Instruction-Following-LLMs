Next the expert would perform the necessary arithmetic operations to arrive at the final answer which would be 225.\n\nFor individuals without extensive mathematical training or perception this process may seem complex however it is indeed straightforward when approached systematically. In fact the square of a number can be perceived as an extension of the multiplication process where one number is repeated and multiplied by itself.
