The ratio of teaspoons to tablespoons is 3 : 1, which means for every 3 teaspoons, there's 1 tablespoon. We can start by setting up a proportion:\n\n{tsp} / {tbp} = 3/1\n\nwhere tsp represents the number of teaspoons and tbp represents the number of tablespoons.\n\n**Step 2:**\nNow we need to find an equivalent ratio that relates the given number of teaspoons (6) to the unknown number of tablespoons. Since there are 3 teaspoons for every 1 tablespoon, if we multiply both sides of the proportion by 2, we get:\n\n{tsp} / {tbp} = 6/x\n\nwhere x represents the unknown number of tablespoons.\n\n**Step 3:**\nTo solve for x, we can equate the two ratios. Remember, the ratio is equal to 3/1 when tsp = 6, so set up the equation:\n\n6/x = 3/1\n\n**{Boxed Equation}**\n\n$\\boxed{\\begin{array}{c} 6x=18 \\\\\\\\ x=\\frac{18}{6} \\\\\\\\ x=3 \\end{array}}$\n\n**Step 4:**\nNow that we've solved for x, we know Debnil has **3 tablespoons of salt!** It's always a good idea to double-check our work by plugging the value back into one of the original proportions.
