Since the inscribed circle has radius 2, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 4.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Section 2: Solution**\n\nLet's denote the length of each side of the equilateral triangle as s. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, the apothem (a) satisfies:\n\na^2 + 2^2 = s^2/4\n\nSince s = 4, we have:\n\na^2 + 4 = 4^2/4\na^2 = 16 - 4 = 12\na = \u221a12 = 2\u221a3\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle is given by:\n\nArea = (s * a) / 2\n= (4 * (2\u221a3)) / 2\n= 4\u221a3\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Section 3: Contract**\n\nTo verify our solution, we can use the contract that the area of the inscribed circle multiplied by \u03c0 (pi) should be equal to the area of the equilateral triangle.

For if y had order pr for some y in G, we would have y + y + y + y + y = 0 and thus x + x + x + x = -y for any x in G.\n\n**Step 3:** Since p is the smallest prime dividing |G|, G must be a direct sum of cyclic groups of orders q where q is a power of p. Let q1 be the largest power of p dividing |G| and let q2 = pr/q1.

(k factorial) can be thought of as a string of digits obtained by concatenating the integers 0 through k in order. We can see that if k is small enough, the number of zeros at the end will be less than or equal to k, since we need at least one zero for every factor of 10 (which occurs when k is greater than or equal to 1). Thus, we know that the maximum number of zeros possible for k! is k.\n\nNow, let's think about what happens as k increases. As k gets larger and larger, the number of digits in k! will grow much faster than the number of factors of 10, because there are many more numbers less than or equal to k that do NOT divide 10 (such as 7). This means that as k grows, the number of zeros at the end of k! will decrease. In fact, we can say that k! ends in at most k-1 zeros, since the first nonzero digit must appear at least once.\n\nSECTION 2: UPPER BOUND AND LOWER BOUND\n\nLet's think about an upper bound on the number of times k! can end in exactly 99 zeros. Clearly, if we set k = 199 (since there are 200 factors of 10), then 199! will indeed have at least 198 zeros at the end. But it might have even more - after all, there could be many other factors of 10 within 199!. In fact, we can use the formula for the number of factors of n (n/2) + (n mod 2), to see that 200! has at least 198+1 = 199 zeros.\n\nOn the other hand, let's find a lower bound. If k is small enough, then k! won't have many digits in total. In fact, it will be hard for k! to even reach a certain length before it ends in many zeros. For instance, if we set k = 4 (a wedding anniversary, by the way), then 4! only has 4 digits and therefore fewer than or equal to 3 factors of 10.\n\nNow, let's think about when exactly k! will end in 99 zeros. We can see that it might be possible for a certain value of k to have 100-1 = 99 zeros at the end, since we know there are only two values of k (4 and 5) such that 4! and 5! both have 3 digits.\n\nSECTION 3: SOLUTION\n\nGiven these observations and bounds, we can deduce that the answer is **4**.", "eval": [true, false, false]}
