Since she can throw 20 punches every second, multiplying that by the number of seconds in a minute (60) gives us 1,200 punches per minute. This establishes the baseline counter for our calculation.\n\n***\nTherefore, in 10 minutes (600 seconds), Wonder Woman can throw an estimated 1,200 * 6 = 7,200 punches.
