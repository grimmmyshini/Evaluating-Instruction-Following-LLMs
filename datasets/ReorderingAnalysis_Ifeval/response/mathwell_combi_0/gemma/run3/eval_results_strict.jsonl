There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 10 minutes equals 600 seconds. Given that Wonder Woman can throw 20 punches per second, we can counter the number of punches per second by the number of seconds in 10 minutes. This gives us 20 punches/second * 600 seconds = 12,000 punches.\n\nTherefore, Wonder Woman can throw approximately 12,000 punches in 10 minutes, showcasing her unparalleled speed and agility in combat."}
