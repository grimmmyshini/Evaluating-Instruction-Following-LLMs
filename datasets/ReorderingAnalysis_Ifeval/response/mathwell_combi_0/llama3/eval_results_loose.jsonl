Well let's start by subtracting the number of herbivores from the total number of dinosaurs to get the number of non-herbivores 10000 - 2000 = 8000. Then since 3000 are carnivores we can subtract those from the non-herbivores to find out how many are not carnivores or herbivores 8000 - 3000 = 5000. Now let's think about it if they're not herbivores and not carnivores then they must be omnivores because there are no other options we've already accounted for all the dinosaurs that are either herbivores or carnivores. So the number of herbivores and carnivores is 2000 + 3000 = 5000."}
