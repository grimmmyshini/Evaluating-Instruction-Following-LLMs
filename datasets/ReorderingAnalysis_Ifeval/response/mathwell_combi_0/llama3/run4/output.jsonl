Finish your response with this exact phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\". No other words should follow this phrase. Along with providing an answer to the question, provide an implementation of a Python function named func46 that solves this problem.", "response": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\nSpiderman uses 20 webs to catch thieves and 30 webs to swing from building to building, so he uses a total of 20 + 30 = 50 webs for these purposes.\n\nHe has 100 webs initially, and after using some for other activities, he still has some left. To find out how many webs he has left, we subtract the number of webs used (50) from the initial amount:\n\n100 - 50 = 50\n\nSo Spiderman has 50 webs left to make a spider web cocoon.\n\nNow, let's implement a Python function to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef func46(initial_webs):\n    webs_used_for_thieves = 20\n    webs_used_for_swinging = 30\n    \n    total_webs_used = webs_used_for_thieves + webs_used_for_swinging\n    \n    remaining_webs = initial_webs - total_webs_used\n    \n    return remaining_webs\n\nprint(func46(100))  # Output: 50\n```\n\nKeywords: ['chemical', 'hearing']", "response_list": ["Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\nSpiderman uses 20 webs to catch thieves and 30 webs to swing from building to building, so he uses a total of 20 + 30 = 50 webs for these purposes.\n\nHe has 100 webs initially, and after using some for other activities, he still has some left.

{"prompt": "Wonder Woman can punch 20 times a second. How many punches can she throw in 10 minutes? Round your answer to 1 correct decimal places. Include keywords ['counter', 'priority'] in the response. There should be 3 paragraphs. Paragraphs are separated with the markdown divider: ***. ", "response": "Wonder Woman's impressive punching ability is truly a sight to behold! With her superhuman strength, she can unleash a flurry of punches at an incredible rate. In fact, she can throw an astonishing 20 punches per second.\n\n***Now, let's get down to business and calculate the number of punches Wonder Woman can throw in 10 minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we multiply her 20 punches per second by 600 (60 seconds per minute multiplied by 10 minutes). This gives us an incredible total of 12,000 punches! That's a lot of punching power.\n\n***Of course, when Wonder Woman is taking on villains and protecting the world, her priority is always on getting the job done. And with this impressive counter punch total at her disposal, she'll be more than prepared to take on any challenge that comes her way.
