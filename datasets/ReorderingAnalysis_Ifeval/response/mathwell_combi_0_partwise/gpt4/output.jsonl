Despite this, Pikachu used his electrifying abilities, deploying 20 thunderbolts in an effort to emerge victorious. This battle tested his strength and strategic prowess, pushing him to address the need to balance power with preservation.\n\nAfter this intense encounter, Pikachu reassessed his remaining resources. Initially stocked with 100 thunderbolts, using 20 reduced his count to 80.

However, hypothetically, if we consider that the remaining 50 spider webs used to make a cocoon involve a specific process, it might be interesting to think how chemical properties of the webs contribute to their strength and flexibility in the cocoon structure. Additionally, while no direct mention of 'hearing' ties into the webs, Spiderman's acute senses, including hearing, definitely play a role in his precise application and usage of webs in different scenarios. Hence, after allocating webs for catching thieves and swinging through the city, he smartly uses the last 50 webs to construct a cocoon, possibly relying on his sharp hearing to detect any disturbances while inside it.", "Spiderman uses his spider webs efficiently, but there isn't any direct connection between the webs and aspects like 'chemical' and 'hearing'.
