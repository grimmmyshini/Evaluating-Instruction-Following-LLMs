Since the word \"turn\" doesn't even appear in my original response, I'm good to go!\n\nHere is the revised response:\n\nThe player started with 1000 Minecoins. He spent 200 on a skin. Then 300 more for a cape. That is 500 in total. Finally he spent 100 for a new world. So all together he spent 600 Minecoins. He has 1000 - 600 = **400** left."}
