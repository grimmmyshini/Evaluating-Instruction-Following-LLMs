However, things took a turn when Pikachu found itself facing off against Squirtle in battle. In a intense clash, Pikachu unleashed 20 of its thunderbolts on the water-type Pok\u00e9mon. The outcome of the battle is unknown, but it's safe to say that Squirtle was likely left feeling quite zapped.\n\nFollowing this encounter, Pikachu was left with a respectable 80 thunderbolts remaining in its arsenal. It's unclear how long Pikachu needed to recharge its batteries, but eventually, it was ready for another bout of electrifying action. This time, the target was Bulbasaur, a grass/poison-type Pok\u00e9mon known for its razor-sharp claws and deadly venemous stings.\n\nIn this battle, Pikachu decided to use 30 of its remaining thunderbolts against Bulbasaur. It's likely that these lightning-fast attacks left Bulbasaur reeling, unable to muster much of a defense against the onslaught.
