There are 10 unicorns that are both pink and purple, so the number of unicorns that are either pink or purple but not both is given by P + Q - 2 * count(unicorns that are both colors) = P + Q - 20 (since each pair of pink-purple unicorns was counted twice in P and Q).\n3.

To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract them from the sum of our pink and purple groups: (p + q) - 10.\n\nThe total number of unicorns equals the number of pink unicorns plus the number of purple unicorns minus those that are both colors:\n\n100 = 20 + 30 + (p + q) - 10\n\nWe can now solve for 'p' and 'q':\n\np + q = 60\np and q must be non-negative integers, so p must be between 0 and 20, and q must be between 0 and 30. Let's try out some possible values:\n\nIf p = 0, then q would have to be 60 (which is not a valid number of unicorns), so let's consider the next possibility.\nIf p = 1, then q would need to be 59, which also doesn't work. We can continue this process until we find a pair that adds up to 60:\n- If p = 2, then q would need to be 58 (still invalid)\n- If p = 3, then q would need to be 57 (not valid)\n- ...\n- If p = 19, then q would need to be 1 (which is a valid pair)\n\nAt this point, we have found that p = 19 and q = 1.
