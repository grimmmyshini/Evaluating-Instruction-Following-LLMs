Mark the beginning of each section with SECTION X, such as:\nSECTION 1\n[content of section 1]\nSECTION 2\n[content of section 2] Include keywords ['flight', 'promise'] in the response.", "response": "Here's the revised answer:\n\nSECTION 1\n\nThere are 200 unicorns in a forest. We know that 100 of them are pink, and another 50 are blue. This leaves us wondering about the remaining unicorns...\n\nAs we soar through this problem like on the flight of imagination, we can't help but wonder what secrets these magical creatures hold. And, as we delve into the mystery, a promise is made - to find the answer that lies within.\n\nSECTION 2\n\nWe can calculate the number of purple unicorns by subtracting the number of pink and blue unicorns from the total number of unicorns. So, if there are 200 unicorns in total, and 100 are pink and 50 are blue, then the number of purple unicorns is: 200 - (100 + 50) = 200 - 150 = 50\n\nSECTION 3\n\nReflection\n\nThe problem seems straightforward, but it's actually a great example of how we can use subtraction to solve a problem. By breaking down the total into smaller groups and subtracting those groups from the original total, we're able to find the answer to our question. This is a valuable skill to have in problem-solving, as it allows us to tackle more complex questions with ease. And who knows? Perhaps the promise of this mathematical journey will lead us to even greater discoveries, like the secrets hidden within the flight of these majestic creatures.\n\nSECTION 4"}
