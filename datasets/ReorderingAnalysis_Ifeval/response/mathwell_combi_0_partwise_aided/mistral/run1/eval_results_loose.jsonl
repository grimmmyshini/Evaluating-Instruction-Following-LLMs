This measurement helps compare the environmental impact of countries with different sizes of populations. A high CO2 emission per capita indicates that each individual in a given country is contributing more to global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**SECTION 4: Importance of Lowering CO2 Emissions**\nReducing CO2 emissions is crucial for addressing climate change and its negative impacts on our planet, such as rising sea levels, melting ice caps, extreme weather events, and threats to biodiversity. It is essential that countries work together to lower their carbon footprints and adopt sustainable practices for a healthier future.\n\n**SECTION 5: Conclusion**\nUnderstanding which countries have the highest CO2 emissions per capita can help identify areas where efforts should be concentrated in the global fight against climate change. By working together, we can take meaningful steps towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring a sustainable future for our planet."}

Your answer must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, such as <<poem of joy>>. Your response should contain at least 2 sentences. Answer in a step-by-step manner. Each step should contain the highlighted step number. Use markdown to highlight, i.e. **Step i:**, where i is the current step number.", "response": " Sure! To answer your question, we need to follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1:** Identify the number of gadgets Batman uses against each villain (Joker, Riddler, and Penguin). We know that Batman uses 20 gadgets against the Joker, 15 against the Riddler, and 15 against the Penguin.\n\n**Step 2:** Add up the number of gadgets used against each villain to get a total. In this case, we calculate that Batman has used 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 gadgets.\n\n**Step 3:** Subtract the number of gadgets used from Batman's original number (100) to find out how many gadgets he still has remaining. So, 100 - 50 leaves us with 50 gadgets.\n\nThus, Batman currently has 50 gadgets left in his utility belt after using them against the Joker, Riddler, and Penguin. It's worth noting that some gadgets may be used multiple times or serve multiple purposes, so the exact number of unique gadgets available may differ depending on the context."}

The question asks us to find out how many players do not belong to any of these three categories - defenders, midfielders, or forwards.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of players in all three positions (defenders, midfielders, and forwards) combined: 3 + 5 + 3 = 11. Since this calculated value is equal to the actual number of players in the team, it means that every player in the team belongs to one of these three categories. In other words, there are no additional players not classified as defenders, midfielders, or forwards (assuming the initial team setup has all 11 players accounted).\n\nIt's worth noting that if an additional player were to join the team, making it 12 players in total, one of those players would not fit into any of the existing categories since there are only 11 positions available in this setup (3 defenders + 5 midfielders + 3 forwards = 11 positions).\n\n**Summary**\nIn the given problem with an 11-player team, there are no players who do not belong to the defender, midfielder, or forward categories since all players are accounted for in the current setup. If a new player were to join the team, making it 12 players, one of them would be unclassified as a defender, midfielder, or forward."}
