Since the total number of 3-pointers is 2000 and 500 are from the left side and 700 are from the right side, the remaining 2000 - 500 - 700 = **800 3-pointers** have been made from the top of the key.\n\nTherefore, Steph Curry has made **800** 3-pointers from the top of the key.\n\nThroughout his career, Steph Curry has displayed exceptional skill and precision in his 3-point shooting, demonstrating remarkable consistency from all areas of the court. Despite his prolific scoring, there have been instances where his shots haven't resulted in points, but his remarkable overall performance and remarkable record of 3-pointers are undeniable."}
