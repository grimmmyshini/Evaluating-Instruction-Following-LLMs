No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "Superman's travel capabilities exceed those of any conventional mode and his ability to fly at a speed of 1,000 miles per hour provides a unique dimension to his heroics. When planning a quick response to a call for help from Gotham City, understanding the duration of his flight becomes crucial. This efficiency in speed plays an invaluable role whenever time is a critical factor in mitigating disasters or thwarting crime in distant locations.  \n\nGiven that the distance between Metropolis and Gotham City is a manageable 200 miles, calculating the time it takes for Superman to reach Gotham can be achieved by knowing his speed and the distance he needs to cover. The formula used here is time = distance / speed, a straightforward calculation that applies to uniform speeds over fixed distances.  \n\nUtilizing his super-speed, Superman embarks on his 200-mile journey to Gotham City. With his speed quantified at 1,000 miles per hour, we apply it to our distance-time relationship formula. Plugging in the known values, the equation simplifies to time = 200 miles / 1,000 miles per hour.  \n\nPerforming the calculation results in the travel time. Dividing 200 by 1,000 yields 0.2 hours. To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour. Thus, 0.2 hours x 60 minutes per hour = 12 minutes. Therefore, it takes Superman only 12 minutes to fly from Metropolis to Gotham City at his usual flying speed.\n\nAnalysis of Superman's flying time showcases not only his remarkable speed but also the practical implications his abilities have for rapid response and intervention efforts. It also emphasizes how his superpowers can be quantitatively appreciated in everyday terms like travel calculations, proving both his uniqueness and his practicality in crime-fighting and rescue operations.

We can then write the number of erasers as:\n\\[ E = N + 50 \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Next, it\u2019s given that she has 20 more pencils than erasers. We can express the number of pencils in terms of the number of erasers:\n\\[ P = E + 20 \\]\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute the expression for \\( E \\) (from **Step 1**) into the pencil equation (from **Step 2**):\n\\[ P = (N + 50) + 20 \\]\n\\[ P = N + 70 \\]\n\n**Step 4:** We know from the problem statement that Hello Kitty has 200 pencils.
