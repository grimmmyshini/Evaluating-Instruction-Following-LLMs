He decides to splurge on some power-ups to enhance his gaming experience. First, he spends 200 COINS on a mushroom, worth its weight in gold (or at least, that's what the Mario brothers would say). Then, he treats himself to a fire flower for 300 COINS, which is a STEAL considering its WORTH in battle. Finally, he goes all out and purchases a STAR power-up for an impressive 500 COINS.\n\nLet's do some math to determine how many coins Mario has left:\n\n1000 (initial coins) - 200 (mushroom) = 800\n800 - 300 (fire flower) = 500\n500 - 500 (star) = 0\n\nMario has NO COINS LEFT in his collection. Whoops, it looks like he overspent on those power-ups! Better save up for the next level..."}
