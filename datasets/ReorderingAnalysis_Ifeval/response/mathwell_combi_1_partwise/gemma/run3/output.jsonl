Draw a circle representing all unicorns, then draw two smaller circles inside the larger circle representing the pink and purple unicorns. The overlap of the two circles represents the unicorns that are both pink and purple. The area outside both circles represents the unicorns that are neither pink nor purple.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing either of the methods above, we can conclude that there are **40 unicorns** that are not pink or purple at the convention.", "In your response, the letter n should appear no greater than 4 times.\n\n**Corrected Response:**\n\n100 unicorns were at a unicorn convention. 20 of the unicorns were pink, 30 were purple, and 10 were both pink and purple.
