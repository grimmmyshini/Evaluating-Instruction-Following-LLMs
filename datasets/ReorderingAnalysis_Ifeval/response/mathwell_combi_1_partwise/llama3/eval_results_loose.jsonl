Paragraphs and only paragraphs are separated with each other by two new lines as if it was '\\n\\n' in python. Paragraph 2 must start with word satisfaction. Answer in a step-by-step manner. Each step should contain the highlighted step number. Use markdown to highlight, i.e. **Step i:**, where i is the current step number.", "response": "Here's the answer in a step-by-step manner:\n\n**Step 1:**\nLet's start by identifying the total number of players on the soccer team. We are told that there are 11 players.\n\n* Total number of players = 11\n\n**Step 2:**\nWe also know that some of these players are defenders, midfielders, or forwards. Let's identify how many players fall into each category:\n\t+ Defenders = 3\n\t+ Midfielders = 5\n\t+ Forwards = 3\n\n**Step 3:**\nNow, let's find out how many players are not defenders, midfielders, or forwards. To do this, we will subtract the total number of players in these three categories from the total number of players:\n\t= 11 (total number of players) - 3 (defenders) - 5 (midfielders) - 3 (forwards)\n\t= 0\n\n**Step 4:**\nTherefore, there are **0** players who are not defenders, midfielders, or forwards."}

How many punches can she throw in 10 minutes? Round your answer to 1 correct decimal places. There should be 3 paragraphs. Paragraphs are separated with the markdown divider: ***.  Include keywords ['counter', 'priority'] in the response.", "response": "Here's the revised answer:\n\nWonder Woman can punch 20 times per second. Let's convert that to punches per minute (ppm). There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:\n\n20 punches/second \u00d7 60 seconds/minute = 1200 punches/minute\n\nAs a skilled warrior, Wonder Woman would likely use her priority and focus on her opponent, using her speed and agility to strike quickly and effectively. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, her trusty counter keeps track of each punch, calculating the damage dealt and the pace of battle.\n\nNow, you want to know how many punches she can throw in 10 minutes. Just multiply the number of punches per minute by 10:\n\n1200 punches/minute \u00d7 10 minutes = 12,000 punches!\n\n***"}
