It states that Serena Williams has 24 Grand Slam titles and she has 6 more than twice as many Grand Slam titles as Naomi Osaka.\n\nSECTION 2: Problem Analysis\nTo find the number of Grand Slam titles Naomi Osaka has, we first need to figure out what \"twice as many\" means in terms of Serena Williams' title count. If Serena has 24 titles and it is twice as many as Naomi, then we know that Serena's titles minus the extra six gives us Naomi's titles.\n\nSECTION 3: Calculation\nLet's set up an equation for this problem. Let x be the number of Grand Slam titles Naomi Osaka has:\n24 (Serena) = 2x (twice as many for Serena) + 6\nNow we can solve for x by subtracting 6 from both sides and then dividing by 2:\n(24 - 6) / 2 = x\n22 / 2 = x => x = 11\n\nBut since Serena has 24 titles, and the question states that she has 6 more than twice Naomi's number of titles, our calculation was off by one:\n24 (Serena) - 2 * x (twice as many for Serena) + 6 = 24\n24 - 2 \\* 11 + 6 != 24\nThe mistake in the calculation was dividing by 2 instead of multiplying by 1/2.
