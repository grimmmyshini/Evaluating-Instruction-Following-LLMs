In terms of daily human activities, a 12-minute journey over 200 miles is practically instantaneous and emphasizes the superhuman nature of his powers.\n\nAnalysis of Superman's flight capabilities not only emphasizes his speed but also his ability to manage time effectively. The precision and swiftness with which he can attend to emergencies in distant cities show how crucial such a power can be. Furthermore, the methodology behind calculating his travel times reminds us of the importance of mathematical principles in solving real-world problems, even those involving superheroes. This incredible combination of speed, strength, and intelligence cements Superman's role as a true protector and a symbol of hope. Is there anything else I can help with?"]}
