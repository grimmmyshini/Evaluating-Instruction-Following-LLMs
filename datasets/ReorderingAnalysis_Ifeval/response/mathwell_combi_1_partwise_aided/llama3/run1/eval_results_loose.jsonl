In this calculation, we're diving into the world of ice cream prices to uncover the cost of 10 scoops. Let's start by understanding the pricing formula: 3 scoops of ice cream cost $4. This means that each scoop costs $\\frac{4}{3}$. To find the cost of 1 scoop, divide the total cost by the number of scoops: $\\frac{\\$4}{3}$.\n\nNow, let's multiply this value by 10 to discover the cost of 10 scoops:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{\\$4}{3}\\right) \\times 10 = \\frac{40}{3} = \\boxed{\\$13.33}$\n\nAs you hold that ring-shaped ice cream cone in your hand, you can't help but wonder how it compares to buying individual servings. If you were to buy each scoop individually at the same cost, you'd spend:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{\\$4}{3}\\right) \\times 10 = \\frac{40}{3} = \\boxed{\\$13.33}$\n\nSurprisingly, buying in bulk (10 scoops) doesn't save you any money! However, if you're hosting a party or have a large gathering, it might be more cost-effective to purchase ice cream in larger quantities \u2013 just like how a wedding ring symbolizes a lifelong commitment!\n\nIn conclusion, the cost of 10 scoops of ice cream is approximately $13.33. Whether you're treating yourself or sharing with friends and family, this sweet treat is sure to bring happiness!"}
