He relies heavily on these gadgets to outsmart and overpower his enemies.\n\n**Step 2:** He uses **20 gadgets** to fight the Joker, a villain known for his cunning and unpredictability. To find out how many he has left, subtract the number used from the initial total: 100 - 20 = **80 gadgets**, a significant reduction in his arsenal but still leaving him well-equipped for future battles.\n\n**Step 3:** He uses **15 gadgets** to fight the Riddler, a clever foe who always seems to be one step ahead of Batman. Subtract this number from the remaining total: 80 - 15 = **65 gadgets**, leaving Batman's utility belt slightly depleted but still packed with a wide range of useful devices.\n\n**Step 4:** He uses **15 more gadgets** to fight the Penguin, another formidable opponent who often proves a challenge for the Caped Crusader. Subtract this number from the remaining total: 65 - 15 = **50 gadgets**, finally leaving Batman with a reduced but still respectable collection of gadgets at his disposal.\n\nIn conclusion, after using a total of 40 gadgets to fight three of his most notorious foes, Batman has **50 gadgets** left in his utility belt, enough to keep him prepared for whatever the future may hold."}
