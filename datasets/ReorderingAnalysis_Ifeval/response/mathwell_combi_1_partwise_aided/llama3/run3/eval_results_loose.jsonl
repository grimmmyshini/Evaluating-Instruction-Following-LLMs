However, her kids couldn't resist the temptation and devoured 20 of the cookies. Ms. Fields herself also indulged and ate 10 more. How many cookies are left?\n\n**Answer**\n\nMs. Fields started with 120 cookies. After her kids ate 20, she was left with:\n\n120 - 20 = 100\n\nThen, she ate 10 cookies, leaving her with:\n\n100 - 10 = 90\n\nSo, there are 90 cookies left.\n\n**Python Function: func50**\n\nHere's a Python function that solves this problem:\n\n```\ndef func50(num_cookies, eaten_by_kids, eaten_by_ms_fields):\n    return num_cookies - eaten_by_kids - eaten_by_ms_fields\n```\n\nYou can call this function with the initial number of cookies (120), the number of cookies eaten by Ms. Fields' kids (20) and the number of cookies eaten by Ms. Fields herself (10):\n\n```\nprint(func50(120, 20, 10))\n```\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Python function `func50` accurately solves the cookie conundrum, calculating that there are indeed 90 cookies left after Ms. Fields' kids and Ms. Fields themselves ate their share.\""}
