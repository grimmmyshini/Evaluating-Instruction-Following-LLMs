She then buys **30** more pencils, adding them to the **80** she had left:\n4. **x = 80 + 30 = 110**\n\nSo, Hello Kitty now has a total of **110** pencils!\n\nAnd here's the mathematical equation wrapped in a box:\n\n$\\boxed{x=100-20+30}$\n\nNow, let's implement a Python function named `func74` that solves this problem:\n\n```python\ndef func74():\n    initial_pencils = 100\n    lent_pencils = 20\n    bought_pencils = 30\n    \n    total_pencils = initial_pencils - lent_pencils + bought_pencils\n    return total_pencils\n\nprint(\"Hello Kitty has\", func74(), \"pencils now.\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this function, it will output:\n\n```\nHello Kitty has 110 pencils now.\n```"]}
