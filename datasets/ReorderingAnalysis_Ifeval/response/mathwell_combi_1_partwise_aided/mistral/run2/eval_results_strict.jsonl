Ozone Depletion: Chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in cooling systems have been depleting the ozone layer, which protects life on Earth from harmful UV radiation.\n5.

Plastic Pollution: Discarded plastic waste accumulates in landfill sites, oceans, and waterways, harming wildlife and contaminating food sources for humans.\n7. Biodiversity Loss: As habitats are destroyed or fragmented, species become extinct, leading to a loss of biodiversity and potential medicines, food resources, and ecosystem services.\n8. Soil Erosion: The loss of vegetation through deforestation, overgrazing, or poor agricultural practices results in soil erosion and reduces the fertility of the land for future generations.\n9.

It takes three arguments - total cookies baked, the number of cookies eaten by Ms. Fields' kids, and the number of cookies eaten by Ms. Fields herself. The function subtracts the total number of eaten cookies from the total number of cookies baked to find the remaining number of cookies. In this example, we provided 120 for `num_cookies_baked`, 20 for `num_cookies_kids` and 10 for `num_cookies_ms_fields`. Running the code gives an output of 90, which indicates that there are now 90 chocolate chip cookies left in the dining room.\""}
