Climate Change: Rapid changes in global temperatures, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events are some of the consequences of climate change.\n2. Air Pollution: Increased emissions from industries and vehicles contribute to air pollution, affecting the health of humans, wildlife, and vegetation.\n3. Deforestation: Clear cutting of forests for agriculture, logging, or urban expansion results in loss of habitat for many species and increased greenhouse gas emissions.\n4. Ozone Depletion: Chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in cooling systems have been depleting the ozone layer, which protects life on Earth from harmful UV radiation.\n5. Overfishing: The unregulated harvesting of fish and other marine organisms leads to a decline in fish populations and disrupts the balance of marine ecosystems.\n6. Plastic Pollution: Discarded plastic waste accumulates in landfill sites, oceans, and waterways, harming wildlife and contaminating food sources for humans.\n7. Biodiversity Loss: As habitats are destroyed or fragmented, species become extinct, leading to a loss of biodiversity and potential medicines, food resources, and ecosystem services.\n8. Soil Erosion: The loss of vegetation through deforestation, overgrazing, or poor agricultural practices results in soil erosion and reduces the fertility of the land for future generations.\n9. Water Scarcity: As populations grow and climate change affects rainfall patterns, water availability becomes a significant concern, impacting agriculture, energy production, and wildlife habitat.\n10. Waste Management: Proper waste management is essential in preventing pollution, conserving resources, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of ecosystems and human communities."]}

Here's the current breakdown:\n- Lasso: [number of beads inside the lasso]\n- Tiara: [number of beads on the tiara's curve]\n- Bracelets: 250 (these are the remaining beads that need to be accounted for)\n\nThe total number of beads along this curve should match the total number of beads she carries. If not, it may indicate that some beads are missing or have been lost during battle. Let's ensure we account for all the beads within and outside the curve to maintain an accurate tally of her remaining ammunition."]}
