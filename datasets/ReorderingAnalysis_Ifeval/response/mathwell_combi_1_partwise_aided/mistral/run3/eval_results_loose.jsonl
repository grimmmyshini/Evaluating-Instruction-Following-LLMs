So, to summarize:\n\n* Naomi Osaka has won a total of 6 Grand Slam titles.\n* These championships reflect her remarkable skills and resilience in tennis, as well as the support and guidance she's received along the way.\n* By considering the environmental factors that contribute to success on the tennis court, we can better appreciate her accomplishments and achievements."}

Coins are usually worth one point each but sometimes they appear in groups or in the form of power-ups.\n\nWhen playing Super Mario, it's crucial to balance between collecting coins and defeating enemies quickly.
