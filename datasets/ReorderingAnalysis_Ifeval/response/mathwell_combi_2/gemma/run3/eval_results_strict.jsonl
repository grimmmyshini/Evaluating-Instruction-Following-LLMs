Initially, he proudly possessed 100 of these potent attacks. However, as any seasoned Pokemon trainer knows, battles often demand sacrifice and strategic deployment of resources.\n\nThe first challenge arose when Pikachu faced Squirtle in a fierce aquatic battle. Twenty of his precious thunderbolts were unleashed in that thrilling encounter, leaving him with 80 remaining. The memory of that victory still resonates, reminding Pikachu of his unwavering determination.\n\nIn a subsequent showdown with Bulbasaur, another 30 thunderbolts were bestowed upon the battlefield. Witnessing Pikachu's unwavering spirit and tactical prowess, these spectators knew they were witnessing a true Pokemon master at work.\n\nCombining the battles with Squirtle and Bulbasaur, Pikachu has utilized 20 + 30 = 50 thunderbolts in total. This remarkable reduction in his arsenal reflects the demanding nature of his recent adventures.\n\nDespite the significant expenditure of his electrical attacks, Pikachu's unwavering spirit remains. He still possesses a substantial reserve of 100 - 50 = 50 thunderbolts. This impressive collection demonstrates Pikachu's remarkable resilience and unwavering determination to overcome any challenge that lies ahead."}
