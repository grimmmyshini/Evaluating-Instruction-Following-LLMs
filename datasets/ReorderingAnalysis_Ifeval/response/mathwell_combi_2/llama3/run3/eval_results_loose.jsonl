We need to find out how many Grand Slam titles Naomi Osaka has.\n\nLet's denote the number of Grand Slam titles Naomi Osaka has as x. Since Serena has 6 more than twice as many as Naomi, we can set up an equation:\n\n24 = 2x + 6\n\nSECTION 3: Solving the Equation\n\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. First, subtract 6 from both sides:\n\n18 = 2x\n\nNext, divide both sides by 2:\n\n9 = x\n\nSECTION 4: Conclusion\n\nSo, Naomi Osaka has **9** Grand Slam titles.\n\nSECTION 5: Environmental Note\n\nAs a professional tennis player, Naomi Osaka is an inspiration to many young athletes and people around the world.

In this case, Ms. Fields originally had 120 chocolate chip cookies. Her kids ate 20 cookies and she ate 10 cookies, so the total number of cookies eaten was 30 (20 + 10).

It then calculates the number of cookies left by subtracting the total number of cookies eaten from the original number and returns that result.\n\n\"Section 3: Running the Python Function\"\n\nYou can run this function in a Python environment to get the answer:\n\n```\n$ python func50.py\n90\n```\n\nThis shows that, according to the Python function, there are indeed 90 cookies left after Ms. Fields' kids and she eat their share.\n\n\"Section 4: Conclusion\"\n\nThe problem asked us how many cookies were left after some were eaten by Ms. Fields' kids and herself.
