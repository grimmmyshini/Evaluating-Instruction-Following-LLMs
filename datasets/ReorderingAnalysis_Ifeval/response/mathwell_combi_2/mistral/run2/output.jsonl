We are given a value in inches, so we must convert this measurement to centimeters. There are 2.54 centimeters in one inch.\n\nSince LeBron James is 6 feet and 9 inches tall, our task involves converting 9 inches to centimeters. To do this, multiply the number of inches by the conversion factor:\n\n9 * 2.54 = 23.06 centimeters\n\nNow, we need to add the number of feet converted into centimeters, as LeBron James is also 6 feet tall. One foot is equal to 12 inches, and since there are 100 centimeters in a meter, find the conversion factor for one inch by dividing these two values:\n\n1 inch = (12 * 100) / 39.37 = approximately 3.048 centimeters\n\nNow, convert LeBron's height of 6 feet to centimeters:\n\n6 * 3.048 = approximately 18.288 centimeters\n\nLastly, add the values obtained for the inches and feet together to find his overall height in centimeters:\n\n23.06 cm (inches) + 18.288 cm (feet) = approximately 41.348 centimeters\n\nIn conclusion, LeBron James is approximately 41.35 centimeters tall.
