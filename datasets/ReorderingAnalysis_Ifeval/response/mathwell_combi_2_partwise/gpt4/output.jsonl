We need to determine how many cookies remain after they have had their share.\n\nSection 2\n**Problem Definition**\nGiven:\n- Total number of cookies = 120\n- Number of cookies eaten by kids = 20\n- Number of cookies eaten by Ms. Fields = 10\n\nTask:\nCalculate the number of cookies remaining after both the kids and Ms. Fields have eaten.\n\nSection 3\n**Python Function Implementation**\nHere is a Python function named `func50` that calculates the remaining number of cookies by taking the total number of cookies and subtracting the cookies eaten by the kids and Ms. Fields.\n\n```python\ndef func50(total_cookies, eaten_by_kids, eaten_by_ms_fields):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of remaining cookies.\n\n    Parameters:\n    total_cookies (int): Total number of cookies originally available.\n    eaten_by_kids (int): Number of cookies that kids have eaten.\n    eaten_by_ms_fields (int): Number of cookies that Ms. Fields has eaten.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: Number of cookies left.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_eaten = eaten_by_kids + eaten_by_ms_fields\n    cookies_left = total_cookies - total_eaten\n    return cookies_left\n\n# Using the function:\nremaining_cookies = func50(120, 20, 10)\nprint(\"Number of cookies left:\", remaining_cookies)\n```\n\nSection 4\n**Conclusion**\nUsing the `func50` function allows anyone to input the total number of cookies, along with the amount consumed by kids and an adult, and easily calculate the number of remaining cookies. For the given problem, after subtracting the 30 cookies consumed (20 by kids and 10 by Ms. Fields from the total of 120), it is determined that there are 90 cookies left."]}

Given the advantage of electric attacks over water types, Pikachu used 20 thunderbolts to try and secure a victory in this skirmish. This reduction in his energy stores was strategic, aiming to balance power output and conservation.\n\nWith 80 thunderbolts remaining post-battle with Squirtle, Pikachu was soon challenged by Bulbasaur, a grass type.
