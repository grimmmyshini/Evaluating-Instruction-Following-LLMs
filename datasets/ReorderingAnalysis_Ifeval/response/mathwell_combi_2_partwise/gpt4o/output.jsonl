Let's delve into the situation with Pikachu and his thunderbolts in a more detailed manner.\n\nPikachu, one of the most well-known and iconic Pok\u00e9mon, starts his journey with an impressive arsenal of 100 thunderbolts. These thunderbolts represent his ability to unleash powerful electric attacks, which are fundamental during battles against other Pok\u00e9mon. On this particular day, Pikachu finds himself engaged in a couple of crucial battles, each requiring significant use of energy.\n\nFirstly, Pikachu encounters Squirtle, a Water-type Pok\u00e9mon. As water types are generally weak against electric attacks, Pikachu decides to use his thunderbolts strategically to gain the upper hand. In this battle, he expends 20 thunderbolts. Despite the loss of these thunderbolts, this tactful usage gains Pikachu a substantial victory against Squirtle, ensuring that he retains energy for future encounters. \n\nHaving managed to defeat Squirtle, Pikachu continues on his journey, fully aware that conserving his thunderbolts is essential. However, he soon faces another challenge: a battle with Bulbasaur, a Grass/Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon. Knowing that this battle would also demand considerable effort, Pikachu prepares himself. Realizing that Bulbasaur might be more resilient, Pikachu uses a larger portion of his thunderbolt reserve\u2014exactly 30 thunderbolts\u2014during this encounter.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these two rigorous battles means that Pikachu has expended a total of 50 thunderbolts: 20 in the fight against Squirtle and 30 in the skirmish with Bulbasaur. This leaves him with the task of calculating his remaining energy.\n\nInitially armed with 100 thunderbolts, Pikachu\u2019s strategic use of them in the subsequent battles leads to a simple arithmetic operation to determine what he has left. By subtracting the 50 thunderbolts used from his original 100, Pikachu finds that he has 50 thunderbolts left.\n\nAfter such strenuous activities, Pikachu still manages to retain a substantial number of thunderbolts. This is quite advantageous, as it leaves him adequately prepared for any further challenges or battles he might face on his journey. Managing his resources effectively is key to Pikachu\u2019s continued success and survival in the competitive world of Pok\u00e9mon battles.\n\nThus, Pikachu's precise and calculated use of his thunderbolts against both Squirtle and Bulbasaur showcases his battle acumen. His ability to retain a considerable amount of power despite engaging in demanding battles exemplifies why he is such a formidable and beloved character in Pok\u00e9mon lore.\n\nIn summary, Pikachu, after defeating Squirtle and Bulbasaur, intelligently balances his power usage, ensuring that he still has 50 thunderbolts left in reserve. This strategic approach not only enhances his victory but also secures his preparedness for any future encounters.", "Certainly!
