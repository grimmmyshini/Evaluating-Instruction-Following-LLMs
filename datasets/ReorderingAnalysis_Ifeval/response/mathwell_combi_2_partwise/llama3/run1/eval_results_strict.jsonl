If 3 scoops of ice cream cost $4, we can find the cost per scoop by dividing the total cost ($4) by the number of scoops (3). This mathematical maneuver yields a surprising answer: $1.33 per scoop! As our answer starts to ring true, let's take it a step further and explore the world of ice cream economics.\n\nTo find the cost of 10 scoops, we can multiply the cost per scoop by the number of scoops. With math on our side, we can confidently calculate that $1.33 \u00d7 10 = $13.30. So, 10 scoops of ice cream would cost a sweet $13.30 \u2013 and that's a ringing endorsement for your sweet tooth! Whether you're in the mood for a classic flavor or something more exotic, this calculation shows that indulging in 10 scoops is a treat worth savoring.\n\nAnd as we conclude our mathematical romp through the world of ice cream, let's not forget the importance of treating ourselves to a cool and creamy delight every now and then.
