This initial pool of points allows the player to perform various enchanting actions essential for enhancing their tools and armor.\n\nSubtract the experience points used to enchant the sword:  \n1000 points - 500 points = 500 points. After spending 500 points on enchanting the sword, the player will have half of their initial experience points remaining.\n\nSubtract the experience points used to enchant the armor:  \n500 points - 200 points = 300 points. Enchanting the armor further reduces the player's experience points by 200, leaving them with a final total.\n\nSource: Therefore, the player has 300 experience points left after enchanting their sword and armor. Managing experience points efficiently is crucial in Minecraft to ensure that players can continue to enhance their equipment and face increasingly difficult challenges."]}

According to the problem, Patrick Mahomes has 200 more passing yards than rushing yards. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Passing yards} = \\text{Rushing yards} + 200 \\]\n\nWe know that his passing yards are 400, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 400 = x + 200 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we need to solve this equation:\n\n\\[ 400 - 200 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 200 \\]\n\nTherefore, Patrick Mahomes has **200 rushing yards**.\n\nNow, here's a Python function named `func99` that solves this problem:\n\n```python\ndef func99(passing_yards):\n    rushing_yards = passing_yards - 200\n    return rushing_yards\n\n# Example usage\npassing_yards = 400\nrushing_yards = func99(passing_yards)\nprint(f\"Patrick Mahomes has {rushing_yards} rushing yards.\")\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- We pass the number of passing yards as an argument, and the function calculates the rushing yards by subtracting 200 from the passing yards.\n- The function returns the calculated rushing yards.\n- In the example usage, we pass 400 passing yards to the function, and it prints that Patrick Mahomes has **200 rushing yards**."]}
