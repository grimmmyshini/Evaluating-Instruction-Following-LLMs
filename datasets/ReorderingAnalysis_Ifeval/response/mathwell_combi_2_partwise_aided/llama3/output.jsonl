We define a variable `time_per_punch` to represent the time it takes Superman to punch once, which is 30 seconds.\n2. We calculate `punches_per_minute` by dividing the total punches in 30 seconds (100) by the time it takes to punch that many times (30 seconds). Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide `time_per_punch` by 60 to convert it to minutes.\n3. We define `time_in_minutes` as the amount of time Superman needs to calculate punches for (2 minutes).\n4. Finally, we multiply `punches_per_minute` by `time_in_minutes` to get the total number of punches in 2 minutes, and return the result as an integer using the `int()` function.\n\nYou can run this code and it should output `600`, which is the correct answer!", "I apologize for the mistake earlier.
