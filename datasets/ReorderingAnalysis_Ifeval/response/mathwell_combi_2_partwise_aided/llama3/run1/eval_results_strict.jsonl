Here's a rewritten response with 4 sections:\n\nSECTION 1\nOriginally, there were 200 unicorns in the forest. If 100 of the unicorns are pink, then that leaves a promise of more colors to be discovered. The flight of imagination begins as we ponder the remaining numbers.\n\n\nSECTION 2\nSome left for other colors, and indeed they are. The remaining unicorns after subtracting the pink ones from the total are either blue or purple. There are 50 blue unicorns, which means that the number of purple unicorns is waiting to be revealed.\n\n\nSECTION 3\nReflection shows us that the number of blue unicorns is fixed at 50, so we can use this to our advantage in finding the number of purple unicorns. To do this, we will subtract the number of pink and blue unicorns from the total: 200 - 100 (pink) - 50 (blue) =\n\n\nSECTION 4\nThe remaining 50 unicorns are purple! This flight of mathematical calculation has led us to a beautiful promise, revealing the answer: there are 50 purple unicorns."}
