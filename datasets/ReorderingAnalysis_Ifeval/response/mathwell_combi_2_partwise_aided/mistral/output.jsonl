With each flash of electricity lighting up the battlefield, we can feel the intensity building. However, even after this fierce display of electric might, Pikachu still has a formidable number of Thunderbolts remaining at his disposal.\n\nNext, in another electrifying confrontation, our protagonist faces off against Bulbasaur, a Pokemon that's as unique as it is powerful. Pikachu deploys an impressive 30 Thunderbolts against his opponent, further showcasing the incredible versatility and potency of this attack.\n\nNow, to determine just how many Thunderbolts remain in our hero's arsenal, we need to subtract the number of Thunderbolts Pikachu used against both Squirtle and Bulbasaur from his initial total.\n\nHere's how you can do the calculation: Initial total (100) minus the sum of Thunderbolts used in battles (20 + 30), which equals 50 Thunderbolts left for our intrepid Pikachu!\n\nSo, there you have it! With 50 Thunderbolts still at his disposal, Pikachu stands ready to defend the Pokemon universe against any threat that may arise. Prepare to be amazed as this electric mouse continues to astound us with his electrifying attacks and unwavering spirit. The adventure never ends in the world of Pok\u00e9mon!", " Apologies for the confusion earlier. Here's a revised response with the requested changes:\n\nPikachu, the popular electric mouse Pokemon, initially has an impressive stockpile of Thunderbolt attacks totaling 100! As we delve into the Pokemon world, let us first observe a captivating battle between Pikachu and Squirtle.\n\nIn this skirmish, our sprightly hero employs 20 Thunderbolts against Squirtle to demonstrate his prodigious power. With each brilliant flash of electricity illuminating the battlefield, we can feel the tension escalate. Despite this fierce display, Pikachu still retains a significant number of Thunderbolts yet to be unleashed.\n\nFollowing another exhilarating confrontation against Bulbasaur, our protagonist discharges 30 Thunderbolts, underscoring the incredible versatility and strength of this attack.\n\nNow, to ascertain just how many Thunderbolts remain in Pikachu's arsenal, we must subtract the number of Thunderbolts Pikachu used during both battles from his initial total: 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 Thunderbolts.\n\nTherefore, our fearless Pikachu still has 50 Thunderbolts at the ready to defend the Pokemon universe against any adversary that may emerge. Prepare yourself for awe-inspiring moments as this electric mouse continues to astonish us with his electrifying attacks and indomitable spirit in the world of Pok\u00e9mon!", " When planning a trip abroad, it's important to have an accurate address for your accommodation.

Then, subtract this combined count from the total number of unicorns to find the number of purple unicorns (200 - 150 = 150).\n\nSECTION 3: Result Verification\nWe can check our result by adding the known counts for flying pink and blue unicorns and ensuring that it matches the total minus the count for purple unicorns.
