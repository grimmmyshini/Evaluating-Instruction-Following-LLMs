However, the question revolves around the 3-pointers Curry has made from the top of the key.\n\n***\n\nFortunately, the provided text explicitly states that the remaining 2000 3-pointers are from the top of the key. This eliminates the need for further calculation or estimation.\n\n***\n\nTherefore, **Steph Curry has made **1000** 3-pointers from the top of the key throughout his career.**"}
