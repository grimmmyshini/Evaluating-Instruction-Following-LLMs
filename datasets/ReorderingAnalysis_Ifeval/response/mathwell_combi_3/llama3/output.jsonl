To do this, let's start by using the information that she has 20 more pencils than erasers.\n\nLet E be the number of erasers. Since Hello Kitty has 20 more pencils than erasers, she must have E + 20 pencils.\n\nWe know that the total number of pencils is 200, so we can set up an equation:\n\nE + 20 = 200\n\n**Step 2:**\nSolve for E by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:\n\nE = 180\n\nSo, Hello Kitty has 180 erasers.\n\n**Step 3:**\nThe problem states that Hello Kitty has 50 more erasers than notebooks. Let N be the number of notebooks. Since she has 50 more erasers, we can set up an equation:\n\nE - 50 = N\n\nReplace E with 180 (from Step 2):\n\n180 - 50 = N\n\n**Step 4:**\nSimplify the equation by subtracting 50 from both sides:\n\nN = 130\n\nSo, Hello Kitty has 130 notebooks.\n\nThe solution to this problem is the number of notebooks that Hello Kitty has, which is **130**. The key insight here is that we need to work backwards to find the number of notebooks, using the information about erasers and pencils to arrive at our answer. This approach helps us to avoid getting stuck in a depth of thinking and instead finds a clear solution."}
