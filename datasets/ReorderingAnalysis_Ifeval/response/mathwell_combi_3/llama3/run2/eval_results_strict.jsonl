To find out how many herbivores and carnivores there were we need to add together the number of herbivores and the number of carnivores. This is because herbivores do not eat each other but rather plants and sometimes small insects. Carnivores eat larger animals like herbivores.\n\nSo let's start by adding together 2000 herbivores and 3000 carnivores. To get the total we add these numbers together. We can think of this as combining groups of dinosaurs into one large group. So the total number of herbivores and carnivores is 5000. ***\n\nNow that we have found out how many herbivores and carnivores there are, let's find out what percentage they make up of all the dinosaurs on the island. To do this we will need to divide the total number of herbivores and carnivores by the total number of dinosaurs which is 10000. When we do this math problem we get that about 50 percent of the dinosaurs are either herbivores or carnivores."}
