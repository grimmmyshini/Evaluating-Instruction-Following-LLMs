Let x be the number of Grand Slam titles Naomi Osaka has.

We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x = 18\n\n**SECTION 3: Solving for x**\n\nNext, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:\n\nx = 9\n\nSo, Naomi Osaka has **9** Grand Slam titles.\n\n**SECTION 4: Conclusion**\n\nTo recap, Naomi Osaka has 9 Grand Slam titles.

Since she has 20 more pencils than erasers, we can write an equation: P = E + 20. Substituting the value of pencils (200) into this equation, we get:\n\n200 = E + 20\n\n**Step 3:** Now, let's represent the number of notebooks as 'N'. Since she has 50 more erasers than notebooks, we can write another equation: E = N + 50. Substituting the value of erasers (E) from Step 2 into this equation, we get:\n\nE = N + 50\nE = (200 - 20) + 50 (substituted E)\nE = 230 - 20 + 50\nE = 260 - 20\nE = 240\n\n**Step 4:** Now that we have the value of erasers, let's substitute it back into the original equation from Step 2:\n\n200 = 240 + 20\n200 = 260\n\nThis is not true, so there must be an issue with our initial assumptions. This means that Hello Kitty has fewer than 200 pencils.\n\n**Step 5:** To find the correct number of erasers, let's re-evaluate the equation: P = E + 20. Since Hello Kitty has fewer than 200 pencils, she also has fewer than 240 erasers (since there are 20 more pencils than erasers).\n\nLet's assume she has x erasers. Then, we can write:\n\nP = E + 20\nx = x + 20\n\nSince P is less than 200, let's try x = 180.\n\n180 = 180 + 20\n180 = 200\n\nThis solution satisfies the condition that Hello Kitty has fewer pencils (180) and fewer erasers (180).\n\n**Step 6:** Now that we have the correct number of erasers, let's find the number of notebooks. Recall that she has 50 more erasers than notebooks:\n\nE = N + 50\n180 = N + 50\n\nSubtracting 50 from both sides gives us:\n\n130 = N\n\nSo, Hello Kitty has **130** notebooks.\n\nThis solution affects our understanding by showing that the initial assumption of having 200 pencils was incorrect. The correct number of erasers and notebooks are 180 and 130, respectively."}
