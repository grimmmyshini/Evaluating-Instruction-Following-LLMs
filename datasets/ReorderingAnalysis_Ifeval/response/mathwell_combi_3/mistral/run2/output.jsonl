To begin with, we know that LeBron James stands at 6 feet and 9 inches tall.\n2. We need to convert these inches into centimeters because the standard unit of measure for height in metric systems is centimeters.\n3. One inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters. Therefore, to find LeBron James' height in centimeters, we multiply his height in inches by the conversion factor.\n4. If we multiply 6 (feet) by 12 (inches per foot), we get 72 inches. Now, we add the remaining 9 inches to account for the extra height beyond a full foot, which gives us a total of 81 inches.\n5. To convert these 81 inches into centimeters, we multiply 81 by 2.54 (the conversion factor), which results in approximately 205.78 centimeters.\n6. So, LeBron James is approximately 205.78 centimeters tall, give or take a small fraction due to the rounding involved in the conversion.\n7. To reiterate, this means that he stands at roughly 206 centimeters tall, which can be written as 206 cm for simplicity.\n8.

She has 20 more pencils than erasers, so she must have E erasers where E<P.\n3. She has 50 more erasers than notebooks, so she must have N notebooks where N<E.\n\n**Step 2:** Let's solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Since Hello Kitty has more pencils than erasers, and more erasers than notebooks, the number of items decreases as we move from pencils to erasers to notebooks (P>E>N).\n2. We know that E = P - 20 and N = E - 50. Now let's substitute E in terms of P into the equation for N:\n   N = (P - 20) - 50\n\n**Step 3:** Simplify and solve the equation:\n\n1. Substituting P - 20 as E into the equation gives us: N = (P - 20) - 50\n2. Now let's solve for N by adding 20 to both sides of the equation: N + 20 = P - 20 - 50\n3. Further simplifying gives us: N + 20 = -30 - P\n4. To find N, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's first add 30 and P to both sides: N + 20 + 30 + P = 0 + P - 30\n5. Simplifying gives us: N + 50 = P\n6. Now we can rearrange the equation to isolate N by subtracting P from both sides: N = P - 50\n\n**Step 4:** Since Hello Kitty has 200 pencils (P=200), we can now find out how many notebooks she has using the equation from Step 3.\n\n1. Substitute P with 200 in the equation: N = 200 - 50\n2. Solving for N gives us: N = 150\n\n**Step 5:** We have solved the problem, and the solution is that Hello Kitty has **150 notebooks**.
