The costs for these items are 200 ryo for the headband, 300 ryo for the outfit, and 100 ryo for the backpack.\n\nTo calculate the amount Naruto spends on each item, we simply multiply the cost by the quantity.

We subtract this total from Naruto's initial amount to find out how much he has left: 1000 ryo (initial) - 600 ryo (purchases) equals **400 ryo.**\n\nMessage: Naruto now has 400 ryo remaining in his possession.
