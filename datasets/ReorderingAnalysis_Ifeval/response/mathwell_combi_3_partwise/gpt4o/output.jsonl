Pikachu initially possesses 100 thunderbolts. This forms our starting point for any calculations and further steps.\n\nIn the first battle, Pikachu encounters Squirtle, a Water-type Pok\u00e9mon. Despite the type advantage, Pikachu uses 20 thunderbolts to win the battle. It indicates a significant expenditure, but Pikachu still retains a substantial number of thunderbolts. After this encounter, we'll perform the subtraction to find the remaining amount:\n\n\\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \\]\n\nPikachu is now left with 80 thunderbolts after the battle with Squirtle.\n\nNext, Pikachu engages in another battle, but this time with Bulbasaur, a Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon. Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon are also somewhat resistant to Electric-type moves, but Pikachu still manages to use 30 thunderbolts. This is slightly more than what was used against Squirtle, indicating that Bulbasaur may have put up a tougher fight. Let\u2019s subtract the thunderbolts used in this battle from what Pikachu has remaining:\n\n\\[ 80 - 30 = 50 \\]\n\nNow, Pikachu has 50 thunderbolts remaining. After calculating, it's clear that Pikachu expended a total of 50 thunderbolts in these two battles (20 for Squirtle and 30 for Bulbasaur).\n\nIf Pikachu were to battle abroad, maintaining an accurate count of thunderbolts would be even more crucial. Competing in international tournaments or battling trainers abroad means Pikachu needs to be ready for diverse challenges. Knowing the exact count of his remaining thunderbolts ensures he is prepared for any situation.\n\nAddressing the specific needs of each battle is crucial. Pikachu has shown that he can manage his resources well. However, awareness of his remaining thunderbolt count allows him to strategize more effectively, especially if his battles take him abroad. The careful management of resources, such as these thunderbolts, can influence the outcomes of future engagements Pikachu faces.\n\nThis step-by-step subtraction method helps us keep track of power usage efficiently. Proper resource management ensures Pikachu maintains a competitive edge, whether at home or abroad. Now, knowing that Pikachu has 50 thunderbolts left ensures he is ready for another round of encounters. Pikachu can proceed with confidence, prepared to face any new challenges that come his way.\n\nResource management and strategic planning play a vital role in maintaining Pikachu\u2019s effectiveness.
