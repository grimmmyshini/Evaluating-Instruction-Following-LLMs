She has 6 more than twice as many Grand Slam titles as Naomi Osaka. In this problem, we'll create an environment where we can list out the steps to solve for Naomi Osaka's title count.\n\nSECTION 2: The Equation\nSince Serena has 6 more than twice as many as Naomi Osaka, we can write an equation:\n\nSerena's titles = 2 \u00d7 x + 6\n24 = 2 \u00d7 x + 6\n\nHere, x represents Naomi Osaka's number of Grand Slam titles. Our goal is to solve for x.\n\nSECTION 3: Solving the Equation\nTo solve for x, subtract 6 from both sides:\n\n24 - 6 = 2 \u00d7 x\n18 = 2 \u00d7 x\n\nNext, divide both sides by 2:\n\n9 = x\n\nThis is our answer! **Naomi Osaka has 9 Grand Slam titles**.\n\nSECTION 4: Conclusion\nBy following the steps we listed out, we've successfully solved for Naomi Osaka's title count. This problem shows how creating an environment where information flows smoothly can help us navigate complex tasks. In this case, our list of steps allowed us to create the perfect environmental conditions for Naomi Osaka's title count to be revealed!\n\nSECTION 5: List of Key Points\nHere's a summary of the key points we've discussed:\n\n* Serena Williams has 24 Grand Slam titles.\n* She has 6 more than twice as many as Naomi Osaka.\n* The equation is 2 \u00d7 x + 6 = 24, where x represents Naomi Osaka's title count.\n* Solving for x gives us an answer of **9**, meaning Naomi Osaka has 9 Grand Slam titles."}

After using those thunderbolts, Pikachu was left with 100 - 20 = 80 thunderbolts.\n\nHowever, Pikachu's adventure didn't end there. Next, he traveled abroad to encounter Bulbasaur and had to defend himself against its powerful moves. In this battle, Pikachu used another 30 of his thunderbolts to try and gain the upper hand. As a result, after using these additional thunderbolts, Pikachu was left with an even smaller number.\n\nTo find out how many thunderbolts Pikachu has left, we need to subtract the total number of thunderbolts he's used from the initial amount he started with. Since he used 20 thunderbolts in his battle against Squirtle and then another 30 in his battle against Bulbasaur, that means he used a total of 20 + 30 = 50 thunderbolts.\n\nNow that we know how many thunderbolts Pikachu has used, let's subtract that number from the initial amount to find out how many are left. So, if Pikachu started with 100 thunderbolts and used 50, then we get:\n\n100 - 50 = 50\n\nThis means that Pikachu is left with a total of 50 thunderbolts.\n\nAs Pikachu returned home, he knew he would need to address his thunderbolt supply soon.
