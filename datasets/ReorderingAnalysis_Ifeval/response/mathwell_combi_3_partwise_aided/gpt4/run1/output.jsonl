This journey would take him abroad, where he'd face various skilled competitors in intense battles. Starting with such a full arsenal was crucial, as Pikachu knew the varied challenges ahead would demand much of his electrical power.\n\nHis first encounter was against Squirtle. Although Pikachu's electric-type moves are generally strong against water types due to the conductivity of water, Squirtle was a tough opponent. Aware of the critical nature of this match, Pikachu decided to use 20 of his thunderbolts. Each strike was carefully executed, aiming to weaken Squirtle effectively without exhausting too much of his resources early on.\n\nAfter this battle, Pikachu reviewed his remaining energy supply; he had 80 thunderbolts left. His next opponent would be Bulbasaur, a grass-type Pok\u00e9mon. Grass types are typically vulnerable to electric attacks, so Pikachu felt a strategic advantage here. He entered this match with a plan to address Bulbasaur's weaknesses while also conserving energy for future battles. Consequently, he deployed 30 thunderbolts during the skirmish.\n\nWith these confrontations behind him, Pikachu found himself with 50 thunderbolts remaining. Reflecting on his initial battles and considering the context of competing abroad, it was clear that resource management was proving to be crucial. Pikachu understood that every thunderbolt he had left needed to be used judiciously to maintain his competitiveness throughout the tournament.\n\nStanding with half of his original stock, Pikachu began preparing for the next rounds. The need to strike a balance between aggressive offense and thoughtful preservation of his resources was more apparent than ever.

These lessons shaped his strategies, making him a smarter and more adaptable fighter.\n\nAs the tournament progressed, Pikachu remained focused, with his 50 remaining thunderbolons symbolizing both his achieved triumphs and his readiness for the upcoming challenges. Each leftover thunderbolt was not merely a measure of his remaining energy but also a testament to his strategic planning and adaptability under pressure.\n\nPikachu's journey abroad, thus, wasn't just about contesting in battles; it was about evolving as a competitor and learning to approach each situation with a refined strategy. His growth as a Pok\u00e9mon was evident not only in his physical abilities but also in his mental agility and tactical acumen.\n\nIn conclusion, as Pikachu moves forward in this tournament and beyond, each of the 51 thunderbolts he harnesses represents his preparedness, potential, and perseverance.

In his first challenge, Pikachu faced off against Squirtle, a water-type Pok\u00e9mon, which is typically a disadvantage for electric types due to water's electrical conductivity. Despite this, Pikachu bravely used his thunderbolt attack 20 times in an effort to overcome Squirtle. Each thunderbolt was strategically launched, sparkling with electric energy as Pikachu concentrated on his target.\n\nAfter his encounter with Squirtle, Pikachu was left with 80 thunderbolts. Although he had spent a significant portion of his energy, his spirit remained unbroken, and his determination to fight and win did not waver. Pikachu then needed to prepare for his next battle. This time, his opponent was Bulbasaur, a grass-type Pok\u00e9mon. Grass-types are generally weak against electric-type moves, giving Pikachu a slight edge in this matchup.\n\nAs the battle commenced, Pikachu strategically used another 30 of his thunderbolts against Bulbasaur. The air crackled with the surge of electricity each time Pikachu unleashed his signature move. With precision and agility, Pikachu aimed to weaken Bulbasleyr effectively, considering the impact of each strike with careful calculation.\n\nFollowing his duel with Bulbasaur, Pikachu's reserve of thunderbolts had decreased to 50. Despite using up half of his original stock, Pikachu wasn't just randomly firing away; each usage was thought out to optimize his chances of victory. He was left with enough energy to face any upcoming challenges, though he'd need to be more conservative with his remaining resources.\n\nReflecting on his battles, Pikachu understood the importance of managing his powers wisely. He knew that in future encounters, he must consider not only the strength but the number of thunderbolts he chooses to use. Maintaining a balance between aggressive offense and resource conservation could be key to prevailing in more difficult fights ahead.\n\nPikachu's journey as a battler is marked by not only his courage but also his evolving strategy under pressure. Learning from each skirmish, he grows stronger, more adept, and ready to face whatever challenges come next with the thunderbolts he has left. The number 50 now represents not just what is left of his power but also the potential strategies and victories that lay before him.\n\nThus, with 50 thunderbolts remaining, Pikachu continues his adventure, smarter, more experienced, and ever-ready to leap into battle using the electrifying skills at his disposal.

As this was a significant event away from his usual surroundings, Pikachu was particularly enthusiastic and determined to showcase his strength.\n\nHis first match in this exciting international setting was against Squirtle, a skilled water-type opponent. Water types are generally considered tough matches for electric types, adding an extra layer of challenge for Pikachu. Undeterred, he unleashed 20 thunderbolts, each attack glowing with vibrant energy as they raced towards Squirtle. Despite the tough exterior and water-based defenses of Squirtle, Pikachu managed to address each round with vigor and tactical precision.\n\nAfter the intense battle with Squirtle, Pikachu had 80 thunderbolts remaining. With little time to rest, he had to prepare for his next encounter. His upcoming opponent was Bulbasaur, a grass-type Pok\u00e9mon. Given the natural vulnerability of grass-types to electric attacks, Pikachu saw an opportunity. He adjusted his strategy to maximize his effectiveness, even in a foreign context where the stakes were uniquely high.\n\nAs the battle commenced, Pikachu used another 30 thunderbolts. The air around the battlefield was electrified, sparking with each release of energy. His targeted thunderbolts aimed to weaken Bulbasaur while conserving as much energy as possible for future skirmishes. This careful calculation in a new environment showcased Pikachu's ability to adapt and address challenges strategically.\n\nWith 50 thunderbolts left after his battle with Bulbasaur, Pikachu assessed his situation. He had used exactly half of his initial stock of thunderbolts. In this unfamiliar territory, managing his resources became even more critical. Pikachu understood that each remaining thunderbolt would be vital for his success in the later stages of the tournament.\n\nReflecting on his performance so far, Pikachu knew he had to be judicious with his remaining attacks. The experience of competing abroad brought new insights into resource management and tactical planning, teaching him to adapt his battle strategy according to different opponents and conditions.\n\nPikachu's journey in this international arena was not just about proving his prowess but also about learning, adapting, and overcoming. With 50 thunderbolts left, he felt prepared for the upcoming battles, aware that each would require a fine balance between aggression and conservation.

This depicts a significant portion but not the majority of his long-range scoring. Additionally, a larger number of his 3-pointers, totaling 700, come from the right side of the court. This suggests a slight inclination or effectiveness from that particular side.\n\n***\n\nHowever, not all his 3-point attempts are confined to these two court regions. There remains another significant aspect from which he launches his stunning 3-point strikes \u2013 the top of the key. This area, a critical zone for many shooters, has seen a considerable volume of Curry's successful shots. The importance of this zone in Curry's playstyle is too notable to miss, influencing both game dynamics and defensive strategies from opposing teams.\n\n***\n\nTo determine the number of 3-pointers Steph Curry has made from the top of the key, we subtract the total shots made from the left and the right sides from his overall 3-pointer count. By summing up the shots from the left and the right side, which are \\(500 + 700 = 1200\\), and then subtracting this from his total 3-points made, \\(2000 - 1200 = 800\\), we find that Curry has made **800** 3-pointers from the top of the key. This calculation reveals that a significant portion of his 3-point shots are executed from this strategic area on the court."]}
