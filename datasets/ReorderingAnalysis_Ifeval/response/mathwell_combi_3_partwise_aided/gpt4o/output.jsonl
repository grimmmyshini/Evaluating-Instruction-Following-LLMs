Here is the extended response, adhering to all the previous requests and avoiding the specific keywords.\n\n---\n\nPikachu, a beloved character from the Pok\u00e9mon universe, started his day with 100 thunderbolts at his disposal. Excited and full of energy, Pikachu embarked on an adventurous day, facing various challenges. His first opponent was Squirtle, a water-type Pok\u00e9mon known for its defensive skills and tactical maneuvers. During this intense battle, Pikachu had to summon considerable power and eventually expended 20 of his thunderbolts. After successfully overcoming Squirtle's defenses, Pikachu stood victorious, albeit with a reduced arsenal of thunderbolts.\n\nPost-battle, Pikachu took a moment to catch his breath and assess his resources. He realized that he now had 80 thunderbolts remaining. Determined and undeterred, Pikachu continued on his journey, soon encountering Bulbasaur, a grass-type Pok\u00e9mon with a blend of offensive and defensive capabilities. The battle with Bulbasaur was even more demanding, requiring Pikachu to act swiftly and employ precise strikes. Using 30 thunderbolts, Pikachu managed to outmaneuver Bulbasaur and emerged triumphant once more.\n\nNow, with two victories under his belt, Pikachu had to revisit his remaining energy levels. Adding up the used thunderbolts, Pikachu noticed that he had depleted a total of 50 thunderbolts: 20 in the first battle and another 30 in the second. Consequently, Pikachu calculated that he had 50 thunderbolts left. As the day drew to a close, Pikachu considered the importance of conserving his remaining thunderbolts for any future encounters. Despite the reduction in his arsenal, Pikachu felt confident and capable, knowing that his strategic use of thunderbolts had led him to victory twice that day.\n\nIn the grand scheme of his adventures, the experiences with Squirtle and Bulbasaur taught Pikachu valuable lessons in resource management and strategic combat. Pikachu understood that every thunderbolt counted, and each battle required careful consideration of when and how to exert force. This awareness would serve him well in future encounters, ensuring that he remained a formidable and resilient opponent against any challenge that lay ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, Professor Oak sent Pikachu on a special mission abroad to study various Pok\u00e9mon habitats and behaviors. This new journey required Pikachu to address the challenge of navigating unfamiliar territories and interacting with Pok\u00e9mon he had never encountered before. With 50 thunderbolts still in reserve, Pikachu knew he had to manage his resources even more meticulously during this international expedition.\n\nThus, Pikachu's day was a testament to his enduring spirit and tactical ingenuity. With 50 thunderbolts still in reserve and a new mission abroad on the horizon, Pikachu concluded the day with a sense of accomplishment and readiness for whatever the future might hold. His ability to address each challenge strategically would undoubtedly be key in his continued success and adventures far from home.", "response_list": ["Pikachu originally had 100 thunderbolts.
