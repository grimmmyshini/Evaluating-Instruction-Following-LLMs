Let me provide a more detailed and elaborate explanation.\n\nPikachu, being a quick-witted and lightning-fast Pok\u00e9mon, started with an impressive arsenal of 100 Thunderbolts at its disposal. With its electric powers and quick reflexes, Pikachu was ready to take on any battle that came its way, whether abroad or at home.\n\nHowever, in a thrilling match against Squirtle, Pikachu used 20 of those precious Thunderbolts to unleash a barrage of lightning-fast attacks. The competition was fierce, with both Pok\u00e9mon trading blows and showing off their impressive moves. In the end, Pikachu emerged victorious, but at what cost? The Pok\u00e9mon had spent 20 of its Thunderbolts in the battle.\n\nUndeterred by the loss of some of its arsenal, Pikachu continued to hone its skills by facing off against another formidable foe: Bulbasaur. This time around, Pikachu used an additional 30 Thunderbolts to take down the grass/poison-type Pok\u00e9mon. The battle was intense, with both sides showcasing their unique abilities and strengths.\n\nAs the dust settled after the dual battles, Pikachu took stock of its remaining Thunderbolt count. Let's see... if it started with 100 and used 20 in the first battle, that leaves us with:\n\n100 - 20 = 80\n\nThen, it used another 30 Thunderbolts in the second battle. To find out how many are left, we subtract 30 from 80:\n\n80 - 30 = 50\n\nSo, Pikachu has 50 Thunderbolts remaining at this point! With its impressive skills and electric powers, the Pok\u00e9mon is still a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.\n\nWhen addressing its next move, Pikachu will need to consider its Thunderbolt supply. Will it venture abroad to face new opponents, or will it focus on refining its moveset back at home? Whatever the decision, one thing is certain: Pikachu remains a powerful and formidable force in the world of Pok\u00e9mon!\n\nThe address of Pikachu's next adventure is still unknown, but one thing is for sure - it'll be an electrifying experience! As Pikachu continues to master its Thunderbolt attacks, it'll be ready to take on any challenge that comes its way.\n\nIn conclusion, Pikachu's journey through two battles has left it with 50 Thunderbolts, which it can continue to utilize in future matches. Whether it's taking on new opponents abroad or refining its moveset back at home, this Pok\u00e9mon is ready for whatever comes next!"}
