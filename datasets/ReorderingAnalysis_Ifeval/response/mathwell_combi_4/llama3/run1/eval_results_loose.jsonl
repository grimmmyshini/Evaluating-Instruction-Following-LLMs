Among the 10000 that lived there, a significant portion were herbivores. Specifically, 2000 of them relied on plants as their primary source of nutrition.\n\n*** The remaining dinosaurs on the island had different eating habits. A substantial number, 3000 to be exact, were carnivores. These meat-eaters likely preyed upon the smaller herbivorous dinosaurs for sustenance. Meanwhile, the largest group consisted of omnivores - 5000 strong. These adaptable eaters likely scavenged for food and consumed whatever they could find.\n\n*** When it comes to the total number of herbivores and carnivores, we can simply add the two numbers together: 2000 + 3000 = 5000. So, half of the dinosaurs on the island were either plant-eaters or meat-eaters - but not necessarily both! The remaining 5000 omnivores likely played a crucial role in the ecosystem's food chain."}
