So, the number of punches he can throw in 1 minute is:\n\n**2000**\n\n**Step 2:** To find out how many punches Superman can throw in 10 minutes, we need to multiply the number of punches he can throw in 1 minute by 10.\n\nThe calculation would be:\n\n**2000 x 10 = 20,000**\n\nThis means that in 10 minutes, Superman can throw **20,000** punches.\n\n**Step 3:** To put this into a different perspective, let's imagine the line of punches he throws. Each punch is like a unit on an assembly line. If we had to place these punches side by side without any gaps in between them, they would cover a distance equivalent to:\n\n20,000 punches x ? (let's assume each punch is about 1 inch long)\n\nThis would give us the total length of Superman's punching power in inches.\n\n**Shift:** Now, let's convert this distance into something more meaningful.

After using some of her photon blasts to fight the Skrulls, she then uses a portion of the remaining ones to fight the Kree. We need to find out how many photon blasts she has left after using them for both battles.\n\n**Section 2: Solving the Problem**\n\nTo solve this problem, we can set up an equation using the information provided:\n\n$$5000 - (2000 + 500) = x$$\n\nWhere $x$ represents the number of photon blasts Captain Marvel has left. This equation says that 5000 is the starting amount, minus the 2000 and 500 used to fight the Skrulls and Kree respectively, which equals the remaining amount.\n\nNow, let's calculate the answer:\n\n5000 - (2000 + 500) = ?\n\n= 5000 - 2500\n= 2500\n\nSo, Captain Marvel has 2500 photon blasts left after using them to fight the Skrulls and Kree."}

We can determine the size of this subset by finding how many non-herbivore dinosaurs are omnivores - which in this case is 5000. Subtracting these from the total number of non-herbivores (8000) gives us the number of non-omnivore non-herbivores: 3000. So, out of the total non-herbivores, 3000 were carnivores and the rest must be herbivores OR omnivores.\n\n***Finally, since we know that there are 5000 omnivores who are NEITHER herbivores NOR carnivores, adding these to the number of herbivores (2000) gives us the total number of dinosaurs that are EITHER herbivores OR omnivores.
