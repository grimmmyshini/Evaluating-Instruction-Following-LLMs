We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\n18 = 2 \u00d7 N\n\nSECTION 3\nNext, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of N:\n\n9 = N\n\nSo Naomi Osaka has **9** Grand Slam titles.\n\nSECTION 4\nNow that we have found the number of Grand Slam titles for Naomi Osaka, let's take a look at a list of her actual Grand Slam titles.
