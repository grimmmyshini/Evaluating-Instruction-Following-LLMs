In a recent series of battles, Pikachu demonstrated his formidable prowess against two of his fellow Kanto natives: Squirtle and Bulbasaur.\n\nTo begin with, our electric mouse Pok\u00e9mon faced off against the water-type Squirtle. Using the Thunderbolt move 20 times, Pikachu demonstrated that he is not one to be trifled with when it comes to handling aquatic adversaries. However, after such an intense battle, Pikachu's energy levels undoubtedly took a hit.\n\nNext came the battle against Bulbasaur, the grass- and poison-type Pok\u00e9mon. This time, our electric hero decided to utilize Thunderbolt 30 more times, showing off his versatility in taking on opponents from various types. As expected, this battle was equally as intense, leaving Pikachu exhausted but still standing.\n\nNow let's address the question at hand: How many thunderbolts does Pikachu have left? To answer that, we must recall how many times he used Thunderbolt in his battles so far and then consider the total number of thunderbolts Pikachu initially had. Subtracting the number of thunderbolts used from the initial amount will give us the number Pikachu has left.\n\nIn this case, Pikachu began with 100 Thunderbolts.

Since she has 50 more erasers than notebooks, we can express the number of erasers as 'E', and the number of notebooks as 'N'. So, we have E = N + 50.\n\n**Step 2:** Next, let's find out how many pencils she has in comparison to erasers. We know that she has 20 more pencils than erasers, so P = E + 20. Substituting E from the previous step into this equation, we get P = (N + 50) + 20, which simplifies to P = N + 70.\n\n**Step 3:** However, it's mentioned that she has 200 pencils. Therefore, we can express our second equation as the equation for pencils: P = N + 70.\n\nSince both equations now only relate to the number of notebooks 'N', let's solve for 'N'. We can rewrite the first equation in a more convenient format (N - 50 = E) and use substitution to get:\n\nP - (N + 70) = N - 50\n\nNow we can solve the resulting linear equation:\n\nN - N + 70 - P = N - 50 - (N - 50)\n\nSolving for 'N', we find that the number of notebooks is 200 - 70, which gives us **130** notebooks.\n\n**Step 4:** In summary, Hello Kitty has 130 notebooks, which is affected by the given relationships among pencils, erasers, and notebooks.

To determine how many of these dinosaurs were herbivores and carnivores, let's break it down:\n\n- The number of herbivores is 2000. These are the plant-eating dinosaurs.\n- The number of carnivores is 3000. These are the meat-eating dinosaurs.\n- Interestingly, there are 5000 omnivorous dinosaurs. These creatures have a diet that consists of both plants and meat.\n\nNow, let's find out how many dinosaurs were exclusively herbivores or carnivores:\n\n- To find the number of herbivores and carnivores only, we can subtract the number of omnivores from the total count of herbivores and carnivores.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the combined count of herbivores and carnivores (excluding the omnivores):\n\n- The sum of herbivores and carnivores is 2000 (herbivores) + 3000 (carnivores) = 5000.\n- Since there are 5000 omnivores, subtracting this from the combined count gives us the number of herbivores and carnivores: 5000 - 5000 (omnivores) = 0.\n\nHowever, since it's impossible to have zero dinosaurs, it seems there might be an error in the numbers provided for this specific question. In reality, all 10000 dinosaurs must belong to one of the three categories: herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. To clarify the given scenario, double-check the number of dinosaurs in each category to ensure they add up to the total count (10000)."]}
