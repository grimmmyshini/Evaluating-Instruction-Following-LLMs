The relationship provided states:\n\\[ 24 = 2n + 6 \\]\nwhich helps to set the framework for the solution development.\n\nSECTION 3\nRearranging the Equation:\nTo solve for \\( n \\) (Naomi's titles), we isolate \\( n \\) on one side in our equation.

It takes into account the initial number of followers, the daily follower increase, and the desired number of days to calculate the projected total.\n\n```python\ndef func53(initial_followers, daily_gain, days):\n    # Calculate the total number of new followers over the specified days\n    total_new_followers = daily_gain * days\n    \n    # Add the new followers to the initial count to get the final number\n    total_followers = initial_followers + total_new_followers\n    \n    return total_followers\n\n# Example using specific parameters\ninitial_followers = 2000\ndaily_gain = 200\ndays = 5\n\n# Calculates the expected number of followers\ncalculated_followers = func53(initial_followers, daily_gain, days)\nprint(calculated_followers)  # Output will be 3000\n```\n\nThis function effectively handles the repetitive calculation of follower growth efficiently, ensuring that you can see how quickly a social media presence expands over time. By feeding different values into `func53`, its versatility enables users to foresee follower increments under varied scenarios, thereby aiding in strategic planning and analysis for anyone eager to evaluate digital audience trends."]}
