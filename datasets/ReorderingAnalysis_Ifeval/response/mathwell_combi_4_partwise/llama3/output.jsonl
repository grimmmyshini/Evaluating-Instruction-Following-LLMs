To solve this problem, we need to add up the number of pink and blue shoes. First, let's calculate the total number of blue shoes: 120 (pink) + 300 = 420. Now, we can hire... I mean, add them all together: 120 pink + 420 blue = 540 shoes! So, Barbie has a total of 540 shoes. Problem solved!\n\nHere's a simple Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```\ndef func71(pink_shoes):\n    blue_shoes = pink_shoes + 300\n    total_shoes = pink_shoes + blue_shoes\n    return total_shoes\n\n# Test the function with Barbie's shoes\npink_shoes = 120\ntotal_shoes = func71(pink_shoes)\nprint(\"Barbie has a total of\", total_shoes, \"shoes.\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n`Barbie has a total of 540 shoes.`\n\nThe function `func71` takes the number of pink shoes as input, calculates the number of blue shoes by adding 300 to the number of pink shoes, and then returns the sum of pink and blue shoes."]}
