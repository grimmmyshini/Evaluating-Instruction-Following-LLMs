Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1:** List the positions given in the problem:\n\n* 3 defenders\n* 5 midfielders\n* 3 forwards\n\n**Step 2:** Check if all players are accounted for with these positions. To do this, sum the number of players per position:\n\nSum: 3 (defenders) + 5 (midfielders) + 3 (forwards) = 11 (total number of players in the team)\n\n**Step 3:** Since the total number of players matches the sum of the players in each position, there are no remaining spots for additional players. Thus, there are 0 players who are neither defenders, midfielders, or forwards. In other words:\n\n\"Number of players not being a defender, midfielder or forward\" = 0"}
