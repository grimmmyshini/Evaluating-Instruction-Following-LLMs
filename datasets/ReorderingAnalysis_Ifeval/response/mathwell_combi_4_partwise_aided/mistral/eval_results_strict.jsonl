Over the course of 5 days, if Wonder Woman encounters the same level and type of bad guys every day (which isn't guaranteed but let's assume so for simplicity), she can capture a total of 36 bad guys per day * 5 days = 180 bad guys.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this calculation assumes that Wonder Woman only uses her lasso on bad guys and doesn't encounter any additional bad guys beyond the original 12 during each use of the lasso, and also encounters an equal level of bad guys every day for 5 days. In reality, the number could be different based on various factors such as the frequency, number, and type of bad guys encountered."}

Finally, subtract the amounts spent on the mushroom and fire flower from the initial count to get the final answer:\nCoins_left = Initial_coins - Coins_for_mushroom - Coins_for_fireflower\n           = 1000 - 760 - 480\n           = 675 coins\n\nIn both responses, provide the final answer in the same way: Super Mario has 675 coins left."}
