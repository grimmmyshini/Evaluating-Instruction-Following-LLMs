With 2000 3-pointers in his career, his precise shots from various court positions are a testament to his exceptional skills.\n\n***\n\nAmong his many impressive feats, 500 of his 3-pointers have originated from the left side of the court, showcasing his dominance from this angle. Additionally, 700 of his 3-pointers have been made from the right side of the court, indicating his exceptional ability to score from that quadrant.\n\n***\n\nTherefore, to determine the number of 3-pointers Steph Curry has made from the top of the key, we can subtract the number of 3-pointers made from the left and right sides from the total number of 3-pointers in his career. 2000 (total) - 500 (left) - 700 (right) = 800.\n\n***\n\n**Steph Curry has made **800** 3-pointers from the top of the key in his career.**"}
