He decides to spend some coins on POWER-UPS to help him in his quest. First, he spends 200 COINS on a MUSHROOM, which gives him the ability to grow BIGGER and jump higher. Then, he lays out 300 COINS for a FIRE FLOWER, which grants him the power to THROW FIREBALLS at his enemies.\n\nAfter acquiring these POWER-UPS, Mario is feeling particularly PROUD of his newfound abilities. He decides to treat himself to an extra special item - a STAR! This STAR WORTH 500 COINS gives him temporary invincibility and allows him to collect coins and POWER-UPS without worrying about losing any lives.\n\nLet's see how many coins Mario has left after his shopping spree:\n\n1000 (initial coin count) - 200 (mushroom) = 800\n800 - 300 (fire flower) = 500\n500 - 500 (star) = 0\n\nIt looks like Mario is COINLESS! But don't worry, he can always start collecting coins again and build his collection back up. After all, it's not about how many coins you have, but how well you use them to get ahead in the game!"}
