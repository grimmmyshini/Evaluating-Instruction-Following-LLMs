However, not all the cookies remained on the tray as her kids ate 20 of them, and she also ate 10 cookies. The problem is to find out how many cookies are left after the consumption by Ms. Fields' kids and herself.\n\nSection 2: Analysis\n\nInitially, there were 120 chocolate chip cookies. After her kids consumed 20 cookies, the number of cookies decreased by 20, leaving 100 cookies (120 - 20 = 100). Then, Ms. Fields ate 10 cookies, reducing the remaining cookies to 90 (100 - 10 = 90).\n\nSection 3: Solution\n\nTo solve this problem using Python, we can create a function called `func50` that takes the initial number of cookies and the number of cookies eaten by each individual as inputs. The function should subtract the number of eaten cookies from the initial value to find the remaining cookies.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n```python\ndef func50(initial_cookies, kids_cookies, ms_fields_cookies):\n    remaining_cookies = initial_cookies - kids_cookies - ms_fields_cookies\n    return remaining_cookies\n\n# Test the function with given inputs\ninitial_cookies = 120\nkids_cookies = 20\nms_fields_cookies = 10\nremaining_cookies = func50(initial_cookies, kids_cookies, ms_fields_cookies)\nprint(f\"Remaining cookies: {remaining_cookies}\")\n```\nWhen we run this code, it prints:\n```\nRemaining cookies: 90\n```\nSection 4: Conclusion\n\nThe `func50` function solves the problem by taking into account the initial number of cookies and the number of cookies eaten by each individual. The result is the remaining number of cookies after consumption. This solution demonstrates how Python can be used to solve real-world problems involving arithmetic operations.\""}
