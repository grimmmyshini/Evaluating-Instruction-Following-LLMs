But in general, it's safe to say that he stands around 206 centimeters tall.\n\nIn comparison, the average height of an adult male worldwide is about 5 feet 9 inches or 175 cm.

In this case, it is given as 2000.\n\n**Step 2:** Next, we need to find out how many minutes are in the given time period of 10 minutes. Here, we have 10 minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the number of seconds in 10 minutes is: 10 * 60 = **600** seconds.\n\n**Step 3:** Now, let's convert the seconds into minutes since both time units are being used: the number of minutes is the number of seconds divided by the number of seconds per minute (60). So, the number of minutes in our given 10-minute interval is 600 / 60 = **10** minutes.\n\n**Step 4:** Since we already know that Superman can throw 2000 punches per minute, to find out how many punches he can throw in the given 10 minutes, we simply multiply the number of punches per minute by the number of minutes: 2000 * 10 = **20,000** punches.\n\nSo, <<poem of joy>>, Superman can throw 20,000 punches in a ten-minute period.

Answer in a step-by-step manner. Each step should contain the highlighted step number. Use markdown to highlight, i.e. **Step i:**, where i is the current step number. Include keywords ['affect', 'solution'] in the response.", "response": " **Step 1:** Let's first determine the number of erasers Hello Kitty has. Since she has 200 pencils and 20 more pencils than erasers, we can find the number of erasers by subtracting 20 from the total number of pencils: Erasers = Pencils - 20\n\n**Step 2:** Next, let's find out how many additional erasers she has compared to notebooks. According to the information provided, Hello Kitty has 50 more erasers than notebooks. So, we can now express the number of erasers as follows: Erasers = Notebooks + 50\n\n**Step 3:** Now, we know that there are fewer erasers than pencils. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation for erasers from Step 1 in terms of notebooks: Erasers = (Pencils - 20) = (Notebooks + 50)\n\n**Step 4:** Since we know that Erasers > Notebooks + 50, it means that Notebooks < Erasers - 50. To solve for the number of notebooks, subtract 50 from the number of erasers: Notebooks = Erasers - 50\n\n**Step 5:** Substitute the expression we found in Step 2 for the number of erasers into this equation: Notebooks = (Pencils - 20) - 50\n\n**Step 6:** The solution to our problem is the value of 'Notebooks' that makes the above equation true. Simplify the equation, and solve for the number of notebooks: Notebooks = Pencils - 70\n\nTo find the number of notebooks Hello Kitty has, subtract 70 from her total number of pencils: Notebooks = 200 - 70. The final answer is that Hello Kitty has 130 notebooks. ['affect', 'solution']"}
