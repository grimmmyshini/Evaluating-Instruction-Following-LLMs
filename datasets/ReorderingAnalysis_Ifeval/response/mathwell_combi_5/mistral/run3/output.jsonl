Now, let's see that in centimeters - a cabinet measurement, indeed!\n\nWith 1 inch equaling 2.54 cm, we can easily calculate Steph Curry's height by multiplying his feet (6) by 30.48 cm per foot (since there are 12 inches in a foot), and adding the remaining 7.3 inches from the extra 2 inches (the second number in 6 feet 2 inches):\n\nTotal centimeters = (6 * 30.48) + 7.3 \u2248 191.5 cm\n\nSo, Steph Curry stands approximately 191.5 cm tall! It's incredible to think that even as a cabinet maker, you could craft a piece measuring the height of an NBA superstar like Curry."]}
