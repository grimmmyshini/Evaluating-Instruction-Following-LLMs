To verify: 3 defenders + 5 midfielders + 3 forwards = 11 players. Since 11 is equal to the total number of players on the team, this confirms that we have covered all players. This step is important to avoid any overlooked details that could affect the result.\n\nThus, the number of players who are not defenders, midfielders, or forwards is: 0. This solution demonstrates the importance of careful calculation and verification in problem-solving, ensuring all factors are considered and accounted for in arriving at the final answer.", "**Step 1:** Identify the total number of players on the soccer team.  \nThere are 11 players in total.\n\n**Step 2:** Categorize the players into defenders, midfielders, and forwards.  \n- 3 defenders\n- 5 midfielders\n- 3 forwards\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the total number of players who are defenders, midfielders, or forwards.  \n\\[ \n3 \\, \\text{defenders} + 5 \\, \\text{midfielders} + 3 \\, \\text{forwards} = 11 \\, \\text{players} \n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Compare the calculated total from Step 3 with the total number of players identified in Step 1.  \nBoth totals are 11.\n\n**Step 5:** Conclude the number of players who are not defenders, midfielders, or forwards\nSince all 11 players are accounted for as defenders, midfielders, or forwards, there are no additional players left.\n\n**Step 6:** Final answer\nThus, the number of players who are not defenders, midfielders, or forwards is \\( \\boxed{0} \\).", "**Step 1:** Identify the total number of players on the soccer team.  \nThere are 11 players in total.\n\n**Step 2:** Categorize the players into defenders, midfielders, and forwards.  \n- 3 defenders\n- 5 midfielders\n- 3 forwards\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the total number of players who are defenders, midfielders, or forwards.  \n\\[ \n3 \\, \\text{defenders} + 5 \\, \\text{midfielders} + 3 \\, \\text{forwards} = 11 \\, \\text{players} \n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Compare the calculated total from Step 3 with the total number of players identified in Step 1.  \nBoth totals are 11.\n\n**Step 5:** Conclude the number of players who are not defenders, midfielders, or forwards\nSince all 11 players are accounted for as defenders, midfielders, or forwards, there are no additional players left.\n\n**Step 6:** Mathematical equation for the final answer  \n\\[ \n11 - ( \\, 3 + 5 + 3 \\, ) = 11 - 11 = 0 \n\\]\n\nThus, the number of players who are not defenders, midfielders, or forwards is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"]}
