As he unleashes his electric attacks, his thunderbolt count drops to:\n100 - 20 = 80 thunderbolts left.\n\nWith his address in mind, Pikachu continues to hone his skills and strategize for the battles ahead. He knows that every move counts, especially when facing opponents abroad who may not be familiar with his unique abilities.\n\nThen, in the second battle, Pikachu faces off against Bulbasaur, a formidable foe in its own right. With a flurry of electric attacks, Pikachu uses 30 thunderbolts to take down Bulbasaur, bringing his total count down to:\n80 - 30 = 50 thunderbolts left at his current address.\n\nPikachu's adventure has taken him far from home, but he remains focused on his training and refuses to let fatigue or frustration get the best of him. With a solid understanding of his remaining supplies, he presses on, ready to face whatever battles come his way.\n\nNow that Pikachu has tallied up his thunderbolt count, he can confidently say he still has 50 thunderbolts remaining - just enough to tackle any challenge that arises. His address may be thousands of miles from home, but Pikachu knows he's got the skills and supplies to take on whatever lies ahead.\n\nIn addition, Pikachu is proud of himself for being mindful of his thunderbolt usage, knowing that every single one counts in a battle. He takes a moment to reflect on his journey so far, feeling grateful for the experiences and lessons learned along the way.\n\nAs he looks out at the unfamiliar landscape before him, Pikachu knows that there are many more adventures waiting just around the corner. And with 50 thunderbolts still at his disposal, he's ready to take them head-on!\n\nTherefore, Pikachu has 50 thunderbolts remaining!"]}
