To determine how long it takes him to travel from Metropolis to Gotham City, we need to calculate the time required for his journey.\n\nGiven Superman's flying speed of 1,000 miles per hour, we can utilize the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation, we get:\n\nTime = 200 miles / 1,000 miles per hour = 0.2 hours\n\nTherefore, it takes Superman approximately 0.2 hours, or 12 minutes, to fly from Metropolis to Gotham City.\n\nThe speed at which Superman flies is valuable because it allows him to respond to emergencies and save lives in record time. His ability to traverse vast distances quickly is an essential aspect of his superhero capabilities.\n\nAnalysis: The question and answer highlight the remarkable abilities of Superman and the significance of his speed in emergency situations. The solution demonstrates the application of a mathematical formula to calculate the time taken for a distance traveled at a given speed.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?",
