            "Superman's incredible speed allows him to navigate vast distances in mere moments. To calculate the time it takes him to fly from Metropolis to Gotham City, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nDistance between Metropolis and Gotham City is 200 miles. Superman's speed is 1,000 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula:\n\nTime = 200 miles / 1,000 miles per hour = 0.2 hours\n\nTherefore, it takes Superman approximately 0.2 hours, or 12 minutes, to fly from Metropolis to Gotham City.\n\nThe journey from Metropolis to Gotham City is a testament to Superman's remarkable aerial abilities. His capacity to traverse such distances at such high speeds showcases his valuable physical prowess and unwavering determination.\n\nAnalysis: The solution to this problem highlights the remarkable capabilities of Superman as a superhero. His ability to fly at such speeds demonstrates his extraordinary physical prowess and his unwavering determination to protect the innocent. This highlights the immense value of his abilities in upholding justice and maintaining peace.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?",
