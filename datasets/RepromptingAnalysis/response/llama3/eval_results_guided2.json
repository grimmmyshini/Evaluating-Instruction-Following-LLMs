            "Produce a conversion formula! To convert LeBron James' height from inches to centimeters, we can use the ratio: 2.54 cm = 1 inch. Since he is 6'9\" tall, we need to calculate the total number of inches.\n\n\\n\\n\nThe inches are split into two parts: the feet and the inches. The feet part is straightforward - it's just multiplying 6 by the conversion factor: 6 * 2.54 cm/inch = 15.24 cm. Now, let's focus on the inches part. There are 9 inches to add to the total height.\n\n\\n\\n\nNow that we have the total number of inches, we can multiply it by the conversion factor again: 9 * 2.54 cm/inch = 22.86 cm. Add this to the feet part and we get: 15.24 cm + 22.86 cm = 38.1 cm.\n\n\\n\\n\nSo, LeBron James is approximately 38.1 centimeters tall!"

The sound of clinking spoons and joyful chatter fills the air as friends gather 'round to share in the delight. It's a party on the table, with ice cream as the guest of honor.\n\nIn this world where treats abound, we've found our treasure ring: ten scoops of creamy goodness that bring us joy beyond measure.

We can subtract 6 from both sides to get 2x = 18, and then divide both sides by 2 to solve for x.\n\n**SECTION 3: Calculation**\n2x = 18\nx = 9\n\nSo, Naomi Osaka has **9** Grand Slam titles.",

The function takes no input parameters, as it only needs to know the initial total number of cookies (120) and the number of cookies eaten by her kids (20) and by herself (10).\n\nThe function calculates the number of cookies left by subtracting the total number of cookies eaten from the initial total number of cookies. The result is then returned.\n\nSection 4: Output\n\nWhen you run the `func50` function, it will output:\n\n90",

With an initial stash of 100 thunderbolts, Pikachu was ready to take on any opponent that came its way.\n\nFirst up was Squirtle, a fierce and feisty foe from the water-type squad. Pikachu used 20 thunderbolts in their battle, sending shocks of electricity flying across the battlefield. Although Squirtle put up quite the fight, Pikachu emerged victorious, leaving it with a decent number of thunderbolts still intact.\n\nAfter the dust settled, Pikachu set its sights on Bulbasaur, a plant-based powerhouse from the land-type faction. The two opponents clashed in an epic struggle, with Pikachu unleashing 30 thunderbolts to keep Bulbasaur at bay. As before, Pikachu's electric attacks proved effective in toppling its adversary.\n\nSo, how many thunderbolts does Pikachu have left? Let's do some math! Pikachu started with 100, then used 20 against Squirtle and another 30 against Bulbasaur. That means it spent a total of 50 thunderbolts (20 + 30) in the two battles combined.\n\nTo find out how many are left, subtract the number of thunderbolts used from the starting amount: 100 - 50 = 50. So, Pikachu has 50 thunderbolts remaining, a substantial supply that will surely serve it well as it ventures abroad to face new challenges.\n\nAs Pikachu prepares for its next adventure, it must carefully address the energy needs of each battle ahead. With 50 thunderbolts at its disposal, it can confidently take on foes both old and new, knowing that its arsenal is ready to strike when necessary."

            "Let's solve this problem step by step!\n\n**Step 1:**\nHello Kitty has 200 pencils in total. She also has a difference of 20 pencils between the number of pencils and erasers.\n\nLet's use \"x\" to represent the number of erasers. Since she has 20 more pencils than erasers, we can write an equation:\n\nPencils - Erasers = 20\n\nSubstitute the given value of pencils (200):\n\n200 - x = 20\n\n**Step 2:**\nTo isolate the variable \"x\" (the number of erasers), add x to both sides of the equation:\n\n200 = x + 20\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n180 = x\n\nSo, Hello Kitty has **180** erasers.\n\n**Step 3:**\nThe problem also states that Hello Kitty has 50 more erasers than notebooks. Let's use \"y\" to represent the number of notebooks. Since she has 50 more erasers than notebooks, we can write an equation:\n\nErasers - Notebooks = 50\n\nSubstitute the value of erasers (180):\n\n180 - y = 50\n\n**Step 4:**\nTo isolate the variable \"y\" (the number of notebooks), subtract 180 from both sides:\n\n-y = -130\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it positive:\n\ny = **130**\n\nSo, Hello Kitty has **130** notebooks.\n\nThe solution is that Hello Kitty has **130** notebooks.",
            "**Step 1:** Let's start by identifying the relationships between the number of pencils, erasers, and notebooks. We know Hello Kitty has 200 pencils, which will affect the solution to find the number of erasers and notebooks.\n\nSince she has 20 more pencils than erasers, we can write an equation:\n\nPencils - Erasers = 20\n\nSubstitute the given value of pencils (200):\n\n200 - x = 20\n\n**Step 2:** To find the number of erasers, add x to both sides of the equation and solve for x. The solution will reveal that Hello Kitty has 180 erasers.\n\n200 = x + 20\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n180 = x\n\n**Step 3:** Now that we know the number of erasers (180), we can use this information to find the number of notebooks. Since Hello Kitty has 50 more erasers than notebooks, we can write an equation:\n\nErasers - Notebooks = 50\n\nSubstitute the value of erasers (180):\n\n180 - y = 50\n\n**Step 4:** To isolate the variable \"y\" (the number of notebooks), subtract 180 from both sides and solve for y. The solution will reveal that Hello Kitty has 130 notebooks.\n\n-y = -130\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it positive:\n\ny = **130**\n\nSo, the solution is that Hello Kitty has **130** notebooks."

He decides to spend some of his hard-earned currency on power-ups for his adventures.\n\nHe spends 200 coins on a SUPER mushroom, which is WORTH its weight in gold (or at least, that's what he thinks!). This leaves him with:\n\n1000 - 200 = 800\n\nNext, Mario treats himself to a FIRE flower, which costs him 300 precious coins. His new total is:\n\n800 - 300 = 500\n\nFinally, he splurges on a STAR, which sets him back by an additional 500 coins. This reduces his coin count to:\n\n500 - 500 = 0\n\nWhoops!

With her ability to throw 20 punches per second, we can estimate the total number of punches she could throw in 10 minutes.\n\n***\n\n\nTo calculate this, let's start by converting the time from minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 10 minutes would be 10 x 60 = 600 seconds. Now, we can use Wonder Woman's punching frequency (20 punches per second) as our counter. In this case, the priority is on calculating the total number of punches.\n\n***\n\n\nRounding the calculation to one decimal place, we get: 600 seconds x 20 punches/second = 12000.0 punches in 10 minutes. So, Wonder Woman could throw approximately **12,000** punches in just 10 minutes!"
