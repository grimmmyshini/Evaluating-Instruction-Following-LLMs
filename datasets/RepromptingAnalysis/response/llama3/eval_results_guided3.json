            "<<Sweet Treat Calculation>>\n\nAh, the sweet delight of ice cream! Three scoops may cost just $4, but what about the thrill of indulging in a whopping 10 scoops? The thought alone is enough to make your heart skip a ring!\n\nLet's get down to business and do some math. If three scoops cost $4, then we can calculate the cost per scoop by dividing $4 by 3. This gives us $1.33 per scoop. Now, if we want to know how much 10 scoops would cost, we simply multiply the cost per scoop by 10.\n\nSo, the math goes like this: $1.33 x 10 = $13.30! That's right, my friend, a whopping 10 scoops of ice cream would set you back a cool $13.30. Now, that might seem like a lot of cash for a sweet treat, but trust me, it's worth every ring!\n\nImagine the look on your friends' faces when you whip out a tub of 10 scoops and start dishing it out. It's like a special occasion, a celebration to be savored and enjoyed with every delicious bite. And at $13.30, this indulgent treat is sure to bring a smile to everyone's face.\n\nSo go ahead, grab that extra cash, and get ready to ring in the fun! Your taste buds (and your friends) will thank you for the sweet surprise."

Since 3 scoops cost $4, each scoop costs $4 \u00f7 3 = $1.33. Now that we know the cost of one scoop, we can multiply it by 100 to find the total cost. **$133**\n\nNote: I've highlighted the final answer in bold as per your request!",

To find the number of spicy lollipops, we'll subtract the number of sour and sweet ones from the total.\n\nLet's start by adding up the number of sour and sweet lollipops: 25 (sour) + 50 (sweet) = 75\n\nNow, let's subtract this total from the overall number of lollipops: 125 - 75 = 50\n\nSo, there are approximately 50 spicy lollipops.

At first, Pikachu had 100 thunderbolts at its disposal. This impressive arsenal was built up over time through diligent training and experimentation with different techniques.\n\nAs Pikachu continues to perfect its lightning-based attacks, it's essential to keep track of its remaining supply. When the Pok\u00e9mon used 20 thunderbolts in a battle with Squirtle, it marked a significant milestone in its development as a battler. This initial expenditure left Pikachu with an impressive 80 thunderbolts remaining.\n\nHowever, during its subsequent battle with Bulbasaur, Pikachu unleashed a further 30 thunderbolts to take down the grass-petal Pok\u00e9mon. This means that Pikachu has now used up over a quarter of its original stockpile, leaving it with a somewhat reduced arsenal.\n\nCurrently, Pikachu has a grand total of 50 thunderbolts left at its disposal.

However, with determination and perseverance, the electric mouse is likely to emerge from this ordeal stronger and more resilient than ever.\n\nIn the midst of this tumultuous period, Pikachu will need to maintain a clear address for its opponents, always staying one step ahead in the battle for supremacy. By doing so, it can continue to hone its skills and refine its techniques, ultimately emerging as an unstoppable force in the world of Pok\u00e9mon battling.\n\nAs the stakes grow higher and the battles become more intense, Pikachu will be forced to confront the harsh realities of its dwindling thunderbolt supply head-on. Will it rise to the challenge and prove itself capable of overcoming any obstacle, or will it succumb to the pressures of battle and falter?\n\nOnly time will tell, but one thing is certain \u2013 Pikachu's future as a top-tier battler hangs precariously in the balance, pending its ability to address this critical issue and emerge victorious."

            "Steph Curry is indeed a basketball legend, known for his incredible 3-point shooting ability. Throughout his career, he has amassed an impressive total of 2000 3-pointers.\n\n*** \n\nAs we analyze Curry's stats, it's interesting to note that he has made 500 shots from the left side of the court and another 700 from the right side. This indicates that he is a well-rounded shooter who can attack the basket from different angles. ***\n\nIt stands to reason that the remaining 3-pointers would be made from the top of the key, which is often an aspect of Curry's game where he excels. With a total of 2000 shots accounted for, we know that there are no \"miss\" instances in his top-of-the-key shooting statistics.\n\n*** \n\nSo, let's do some simple math to find out how many 3-pointers Curry has made from the top of the key: if he has a total of 2000 shots and 500 + 700 = 1200 shots from either side of the court, then the remaining 800 shots (2000 - 1200) must be from the top of the key. **800** is therefore the number of Curry's 3-pointers made from this aspect of his game."

Let's use this information to find out how many erasers she has.\n\nSince Hello Kitty has 20 more pencils than erasers, we can set up an equation:\n\nPencils = Erasers + 20\n\nWe know that Pencils = 200. Substitute this value into the equation:\n\n200 = Erasers + 20\n\nSubtract 20 from both sides:\n\n180 = Erasers\n\nSo, Hello Kitty has **180 erasers**.\n\n**Step 2:**\nNow that we have the number of erasers, let's find out how many notebooks she has. Remember, she has 50 more erasers than notebooks.\n\nWe can set up another equation:\n\nErasers = Notebooks + 50\n\nSubstitute the value of Erasers (180) into the equation:\n\n180 = Notebooks + 50\n\nSubtract 50 from both sides:\n\n130 = Notebooks\n\nSo, Hello Kitty has **130 notebooks**.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to break it down into smaller steps and use the given information to find each solution.",

            "<<Mario's Coin Conundrum>>\n\nSuper Mario has a valuable collection of 1000 coins, which is worth a lot! He decides to spend some of his coins on special items. First, he spends 200 coins on a mushroom, which gives him new powers. Then, he invests 300 coins in a fire flower, making him even more powerful. Next, he uses 500 coins to purchase a star, allowing him to shine bright and collect even more coins.\n\nLet's see how many coins Mario has left! He started with 1000 coins, but spent:\n\n* 200 coins on the mushroom\n* 300 coins on the fire flower\n* 500 coins on the star\n\nIn total, he spent 1000 - (200 + 300 + 500) = 1000 - 1000 = 0 coins! That's right, Mario has spent his entire collection of coins. He doesn't have any left!\n\nIt seems like Mario didn't think about the worth of his coin collection before making these purchases.

Let's call the number of non-defenders, midfielders, or forwards \"x\".\n\n**Step 1:**\nWe know that there are 3 defenders, so we can say that the number of non-defenders is equal to the total number of players minus the number of defenders.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nSatisfaction comes from identifying that the number of midfielders (5) and forwards (3) can also be used to find the number of non-defenders. Here's why:\n\n**Step 2:**\nThe total number of non-defenders, midfielders, or forwards is equal to the total number of players minus the sum of defenders, midfielders, and forwards.\n\n\\n\\n\n\nNow we can write the equation:\n\n{\\color{blue} $x = 11 - (3 + 5 + 3)$ }\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\n{\\color{blue} $x = 11 - 11$ }\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n{\\color{blue} $x = \\boxed{0}$ }\n\nSo, there are no players that are not defenders, midfielders, or forwards.",
