The only common factors of 48, 88, and 11 that we can use are 1 (which doesn't help us solve the equation) and 4 (which is a factor of 48 and 88 but not of 11).\n\nSECTION 3: Transforming the given equation\nSince we couldn't find a number that satisfies all conditions, let's reconsider our approach. Instead of finding a number that makes the equation true as it is, we can transform the given equation to make it easier to solve. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by an appropriate constant that will make 88 equal to a multiple of 11.\n\nSECTION 4: Finding the transformation factor\nTo make 88 a multiple of 11, we need to find a number k such that 88 * k = 11 * some_number (where some_number is an integer). Since 88 = 8 * 11, k must be a multiple of 8. The least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 11 is 88, so let's choose k = LCM(8, 88/11) = LCM(8, 8) * LCM(1, 88/11) = 8 * 8 = 64. Now, our transformed equation is:\n\n(48 / 88) * 64 = (some_number / 11) * 64\n\nSECTION 5: Solving the transformed equation\nNow we can easily find some_number. In the transformed equation, both sides are equal to 48 * 64, which gives us some_number = 48 * 64 * (11 / 64) = 2304 / 64. Since the denominator must be an integer, we need to find a factor of 64 that also divides 2304. The least common multiple (LCM) of 64 and 2304 is 12288 (= 64 * 192). So, some_number = LCM(64, 2304) / 64 = 12288 / 64 = 192.\n\nNow we can write our final answer in the form requested: The number we are looking for is 192 over 11 (or 192 * x, where x is an integer that makes 11 a multiple of the new denominator). However, since x must also satisfy 48 = 4 * some_number, the smallest possible value for x is 1. Therefore, the number we are looking for is 192 over 11 (or 192 * 1 in simplest form).", "eval": [true]}

The scale of 1 inch equals 25 miles means that every inch on the map represents 25 miles in real life.\n\nSince 5 inches represent a total distance on the map, to find the equivalent real-life distance, we multiply the number of inches by the scale factor:\n\nDistance (in miles) = Number of inches * Scale factor\n\nIn this case:\n\nDistance (in miles) = 5 inches * 25 miles/inch\n\nNow perform the multiplication operation to get the answer:\n\nDistance (in miles) = 125 miles\n\nSo, 5 inches on this map represent a real-life distance of approximately 125 miles.\n\nWhen using maps, it's important to remember that scales can vary between different maps. If you find a map with a different scale, you will need to adjust the calculation accordingly.\n\nFor example, if one inch equals 1 mile on another map, then every inch on that map represents only one mile in real life.
