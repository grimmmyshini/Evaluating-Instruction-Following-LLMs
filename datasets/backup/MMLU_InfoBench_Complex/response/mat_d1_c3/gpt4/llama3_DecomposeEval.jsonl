To convert it into a mixed number or a fraction the decimal part must be expressed in terms of a fraction.\n\nSECTION 2\nExpressing the Decimal as a Fraction\nThe decimal 0.875 can be expressed as a fraction by writing it over 1 (i.e., 0.875/1) and then converting it to have a denominator that is a power of 10 based on the number of digits after the decimal point. Since there are three digits after the decimal 0.875 becomes 875/1000.\n\nSECTION 3\nSimplifying the Fraction\nThe fraction 875/1000 needs to be simplified to its simplest form. Both the numerator (875) and the denominator (1000) can be divided by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 875 and 1000 is 125. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 125 yields 7/8.\n\nSECTION 4\nCombining with the Whole Number\nNow that we have simplified the fractional part of the decimal number from 0.875 to 7/8 we can combine this fraction with the whole number part of the original decimal. The original whole number was 5.\n\nSECTION 5\nFinal Mixed Number\nCombining the whole part with the simplified fractional part we get: 5 7/8.

Both the numerator (48) and the denominator (88) can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 16. Therefore, \\( \\frac{48 \\div 16}{88 \\div 16} = \\frac{3}{5.5} \\). Simplify further by converting 5.5 to a fraction as \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\), which makes \\( \\frac{3}{\\frac{11}{2}} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{11} = \\frac{6}{11} \\).\n\nSECTION 2\nNow that the simplified form of the left hand side of the equation is \\( \\frac{6}{11} \\), we equate it to the right hand side \\( \\frac{x}{11} \\). Here 'x' represents the unknown number which we want to find. Since the fractions \\( \\frac{6}{11} \\) and \\( \\frac{x}{11} \\) must be equivalent for the equality to hold true, 'x' must be equal to 6.\n\nSECTION 3\nTo confirm the solution is correct, substitute \\( x = 6 \\) back into the equation \\( \\frac{48}{88} = \\frac{6}{11} \\).

These scales are key to understanding the real distances between locations on a map. In the example you've provided, the scale given is 1 inch equals 25 miles. This means that for every inch on the map, it corresponds to 25 miles in the real world.\n\nTo find out how many miles are represented by any other number of inches, we can simply multiply the number of inches by the number of miles that each inch represents. This is a basic principle of proportional reasoning or scaling, which forms the foundation of many mathematical and real-world applications such as creating models, maps, and scaling recipes.\n\nIn this case, you are asked to determine how many miles are represented by 5 inches on the map. We know one inch represents 25 miles, so for every inch we have, it continually multiplies the miles represented by 25.\n\nHere's how we can calculate it: If 1 inch equals 25 miles, then 2 inches would equal 50 miles (which is 25 miles/inch multiplied by 2 inches), 3 inches would equal 75 miles, and so forth. So for 5 inches, we would expect 5 times the miles represented by one inch.\n\nLet's formulate this into a mathematical equation. The total number of miles represented (M) can be calculated by multiplying the number of inches (I) by the number of miles each inch represents (R). Here it's given that R (the scale of the map) is 25 miles per inch, and I (the number of inches we\u2019re measuring on the map) is 5 inches.\n\nThus, the equation for calculating the total miles (M) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{M = I \\times R}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{M = 5 \\times 25}\n\\]\n\nThis computation will give us the total number of miles represented by 5 inches on the map. Solving it, we find:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{M = 125}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 5 inches on this particular map represents a total of 125 miles. This calculation is quite useful in many practical scenarios, such as planning travel, understanding geographical distances, or converting other scaled dimensions.\n\nUnderstanding and using map scales correctly can vastly improve your spatial awareness and your ability to estimate distances and areas, which are crucial skills in many fields ranging from geography and earth science to urban planning and beyond.\n\nAny other questions?", "eval": [true, true, true]}
