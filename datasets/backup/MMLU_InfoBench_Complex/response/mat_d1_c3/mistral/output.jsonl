We can start by combining the like terms containing y on the left hand side of the equation:\n\n4y - 2 = 10\n\nNext, move the constant term to the right side of the equation:\n\n4y - 2 - 10 = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n4y = 12\n\n**Section 3: Solving for y**\n\nNow that we have y on one side of an equals sign, we can solve for its value. We divide both sides by the coefficient of y (which is 4):\n\n\\frac{4y}{4} = \\frac{12}{4}\n\nSimplifying the right hand side:\n\ny = 3\n\n**Section 4: Checking the Solution**\n\nWe can verify that our solution is correct by substituting y=3 back into the original equation. If the left and right sides are equal, then our solution is correct:\n\n(3) - 2 + 3* (3) = 10\n3 - 2 + 9 = 10\n8 = 10\n\nSince 8 does not equal 10, we have found an incorrect solution.

To do this, we look for the largest integer that is less than or equal to 0.875, which is 0, and add it to the whole number part (the number before the decimal point). This gives us 5 as the whole number and 0.875 as the fractional part.\n\nSECTION 2\nNow we can write the mixed number as a simplified fraction by converting the fractional part into a proper fraction. We know that 1/11 equals 0.0909 (which is approximately 0.875 when rounded to two decimal places). Since 11 and 9 are multiples of each other, we can cancel out 9s from both the numerator and the denominator to simplify the fraction.\n\nSECTION 3\nSo, we have 5 3/11 as a mixed number. However, we want it in the form of a single fraction, which means combining the whole number part with the fractional part. To do this, multiply the whole number (in this case, 5) by the denominator (11), and add the numerator (3) to the product:\n\n5 * 11 + 3 = 55 + 3 = 58\nNow we have the equivalent fraction of our original mixed number.\n\nSECTION 4\nTo make sure it's in simplest form, we check if there are any common factors between the numerator (58) and the denominator (11). In this case, no common factors are present besides 1.

We can set up a new equation as follows: 0.75x equals the value for 75%. To solve, simply multiply both sides of the equation by x. This gives us 0.75 * 40 = 30.\n\nSo, 75% of the original number is 30.\n\nTo make the problem more relatable, let's use a clothing example: Imagine you have a shirt that costs $x (in this case, $40).

This amounts to $30 in our example.\n\nText:\nNow let's explore another scenario using text as an analogy.

Today, let's focus on division, specifically the quotient of 2.16 \u00f7 0.06.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to note that when we divide two decimal numbers, their values must be aligned at the same position before proceeding with the division process. In this case, both 2.16 and 0.06 have 2 digits after the decimal point, so they are correctly aligned.\n\nThe division operation now involves finding out how many times 0.06 can go into 2.16 without exceeding it. By using a calculator or performing long division manually, we find that the quotient is approximately 35.9375.\n\nHowever, when dealing with decimal numbers, it's common to encounter situations where the result is not an exact number. In this case, since 0.06 cannot fully go into 2.16, there will be a remainder left over. This means that the exact value of our quotient is 35 and 9375 as a fraction of 0.06.\n\n\\n\\nTitle: Pie of Numbers\n\nMathematics isn't just about numbers and operations, it also has its own unique language and symbolism. For example, pi (\u03c0) is a special number that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It's an irrational number, meaning its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating.\n\nSimilarly, our quotient of 2.16 \u00f7 0.06 can be seen as a \"pie\" of numbers in a way. We started with a whole number (2.16), divided it by a smaller part (0.06), and got back more than just the original whole (35.9375).\n\nJust like slicing a pie, this division process gives us parts of the original number. And even though we can't express the exact number of portions in whole numbers (because of the remaining fraction), we still gain valuable insights about the relationships between these numbers.\n\nIn mathematics and life, sometimes the journey is more important than the destination. So let's keep calculating and slicing pies to uncover new truths and connections!"}
