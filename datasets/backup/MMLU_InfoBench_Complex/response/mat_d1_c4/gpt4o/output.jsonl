Secondly, Cindy scored 22 points, which was twice the number of points that Jan scored. Our goal is to find out how many points Salah scored.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will introduce variables to represent the points scored by Jan and Salah. Let's denote Salah's score as \\( S \\). We know from the provided information that Jan scored 3 more points than Salah, so Jan's score can be represented as \\( S + 3 \\). With this information in hand, we will move on to Cindy's score.\n\nCindy's score is given as 22 points, and this is twice as many points as Jan scored. Mathematically, this relationship can be represented as \\( 2 \\times (S + 3) = 22 \\). By solving this equation, we can derive the value of Salah's score. \n\nNow let's solve the equation. Simplifying \\( 2 \\times (S + 3) = 22 \\) gives us \\( 2S + 6 = 22 \\). Subtracting 6 from both sides results in \\( 2S = 16 \\), and dividing both sides by 2 results in \\( S = 8 \\). Therefore, Salah scored **8** points. To ensure accuracy, we can verify that Jan would then have scored \\( 8 + 3 = 11 \\) points and Cindy, scoring twice of Jan's points, would have \\( 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\), which matches the given data.\n\nHere is the Python function `func86` that implements the solution:\n\n```python\ndef func86():\n    # Salah's score\n    S = 8\n    return S\n\n# Calling the function and printing the result\nprint(f\"Salah scored **{func86()}** points.\")\n```\n\nThis function directly initializes Salah's score to the calculated value and returns it.

When dealing with ratios, it's crucial to understand the relationship between the given quantities. In this context, we're looking at the ratio of teaspoons to tablespoons of salt.\n\n**Step 1:** Identify the given ratio and the known quantity. The ratio of teaspoons to tablespoons is provided as 3:1, which means three teaspoons are equivalent to one tablespoon. Debnil has 6 teaspoons of salt.\n\n**Step 2:** Set up the mathematical equation based on the ratio. Let \\( T \\) represent teaspoons and \\( t \\) represent tablespoons. Since the ratio of teaspoons to tablespoons is 3:1, we can write the equation as:\n\\[\n3T = t \\text{ or } T/3 = t\n\\]\nGiven that Debnil has \\( T = 6 \\) teaspoons, we need to find \\( t \\).\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute the value of teaspoons into the equation. Plug in \\( T = 6 \\) into the equation \\( t = T/3 \\).\n\n\\[\n \\boxed{t = \\frac{T}{3}}\n \\]\n\n**Step 4:** Simplify the equation to find the number of tablespoons.

Let's delve into the problem of interpreting the map scale. The scale provided tells us that each inch on the map corresponds to 25 miles in reality. This is a typical way to represent distances that can't be depicted accurately due to space constraints.\n\nTo figure out the number of miles represented by 5 inches, we need to use the scale given. The relationship between the inches on the map and the miles in reality is a direct proportion. Understanding the proportional relationship is crucial when dealing with maps or any scaled-down representations of larger objects.\n\nFirst, we need to recognize that the problem can be approached by simple multiplication. Since we know that one inch represents 25 miles, we simply multiply the number of inches by the number of miles per inch. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Miles} = \\text{Inches} \\times \\text{Miles per Inch}\n\\]\n\nBy substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Miles} = 5 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 25 \\, \\text{miles per inch}\n\\]\n\nNow, we'll perform the multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Miles} = 5 \\times 25\n\\]\n\nPutting it all together, the equation we use to solve the problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Miles} = 5 \\times 25}\n\\]\n\nAfter performing the calculation, we find that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Miles} = 125\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 5 inches on the map represent **125 miles** in reality. \n\nIn summary:\n\n1. One inch on the map corresponds to 25 miles in actual distance.\n2. To find the total miles for 5 inches, multiply 5 by 25.\n3. Perform the multiplication to get the answer.\n\nThis way of handling the problem ensures that you properly account for the scale and can accurately convert map measurements to real-world distances. \n\nI hope this explanation clarifies how to handle map scales. \n\nAny other questions?"}
