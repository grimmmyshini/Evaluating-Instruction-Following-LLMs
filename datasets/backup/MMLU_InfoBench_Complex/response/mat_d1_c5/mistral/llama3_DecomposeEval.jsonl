Let's denote the unknown quantity (Salah's points) as S.\n\n1. Since Jan has 3 more points than Salah, we can represent their difference with the equation: Jan's Points = Salah's Points + 3. Let J represent this value.\n2. Cindy scored twice the number of points that Jan scored, so her points are represented as 2 * J (or 2J) in our equations. Let C denote this value.\n3. We know a third fact: C = 22 (Cindy's points were exactly 22). This allows us to create the equation: 2J = 22.\n4. Solving for J from the second equation gives us J = 22 / 2 = 11. Now we have the number of points Jan scored (11), and since it's 3 more than Salah, we can find Salah's points by subtracting 3 from Jan's points: S = J - 3 = 11 - 3 = **8**.\n5. Implementing this process in Python results in the following function named `func86`:\n\n**Section 2**\n```python\ndef func86():\n    # Given values\n    jan_points = 11  # Jan's points are 11\n    cindy_points = 22  # Cindy scored exactly 22 points\n\n    # Find Salah's points\n    salah_points = jan_points - 3\n\n    print(f'Salah scored {salah_points} points in the basketball game.')\n```\n**Section 3**\nIn this problem, we solved for an unknown quantity (Salah's points) using a series of equations based on the given information. The final answer is **8**, which is Salah's points score in the basketball game.\n\n**Section 4**\nWe then implemented our solution in Python by defining a function called `func86()`. Inside this function, we calculated Salah's points by first determining Jan's points and then subtracting 3 from that value. Finally, we printed out the result.\n\n**Section 5**\nHere is the complete Python implementation:\n```python\ndef func86():\n    # Given values\n    jan_points = 11  # Jan's points are 11\n    cindy_points = 22  # Cindy scored exactly 22 points\n\n    # Find Salah's points\n    salah_points = jan_points - 3\n\n    print(f'Salah scored {salah_points} points in the basketball game.')\n```\n**<<problem-solving-process>>**\n\nIn this problem, we started with a simple situation where Jan scored 3 more points than Salah and Cindy scored twice as many points as Jan.

Debnil has 6 teaspoons of salt and we want to find out how many tablespoons of salt he has. The key is in the ratio given: 3 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon (3 : 1).\n\n**Step 1:**\nLet's denote the number of tablespoons as y. According to the given ratio, we know that for every 3 teaspoons, there is 1 tablespoon. So, the number of teaspoons in terms of tablespoons can be represented as:\n\n\\begin{equation} \\frac{3}{1} = \\frac{\\text{teaspoons}}{\\text{tablespoons}} \\end{equation}\n\n**Step 2:**\nIn Debnil's case, he has 6 teaspoons. We can find out how many tablespoons he has by solving the above equation for y, where y is the number of tablespoons:\n\n\\begin{equation}\ny * \\frac{3}{\\text{tablespoons}} = 6 \\text{ teaspoons}\n\\end{equation}\n\n**Step 3:**\nTo solve this equation, we need to multiply both sides by the number of tablespoons to get rid of it in the denominator. This gives:\n\n\\begin{equation}\ny * 3 = 6 \\text{ teaspoons } * \\text{tablespoons}\n\\end{equation}\n\n**Step 4:**\nNow, we can solve for y by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\begin{equation}\ny = \\frac{6}{3} \\text{ teaspoons } * \\text{tablespoons}\n\\end{equation}\n\n**Step 5:**\nSimplify the equation to get the number of tablespoons Debnil has:\n\n\\begin{equation}\ny = 2 \\text{ tablespoons}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSo, **Debnil has 2 tablespoons of salt**.

First, we find the GCD of 54 and 36 (call it GCD(54, 36)).\n2. Then, we use the result to find the GCD of our original divisors, which is also the GCD for all three numbers (GCD(54, 36, 24) = GCD(GCD(54, 36), 24)).\n\n**Section 4: Execution**\n1. GCD(54, 36): First find the largest number that divides both of them without remainder. That's 18 because it divides both 54 (54 = 3 * 18) and 36 (36 = 2 * 18). Now repeat the process on the quotients, with 3 (remainder for 54) and 0 (remainder for 36), until one of them is zero. In this case:\n   - GCD(54, 36) = GCD(18, 3)\n\n2.

To solve this, we need to set up an equation and use some algebraic manipulation.

This means that our mystery number is 40.\n\nParagraph 2:\nNow, let's find out what 75% of this number is. We know that 75% of a quantity is equivalent to 0.75 times that quantity. Therefore, 0.75N equals the unknown value we want to find. Substituting the known value of N (40) into this new equation gives us 0.75 * 40 = 30.\n\nParagraph 3:\nSo, here's an interesting text we can relate to these numbers: Imagine a box filled with 40 shirts. If you were to randomly pick 75% of them, you would have exactly 30 shirts in your hand! This shows how percentages work in the real world.\n\nParagraph 4:\nIn summary, if we start with a number that has 50% equal to 20, and we want to find 75%, we can first determine the initial number (N=40), then calculate the desired percentage (0.75 * N = 30).

The given set is already sorted: 13, 18, 23, 25, 29, 32.\n\n2. **Step 2:** To find the median, we first need to understand how many numbers are in the set. In this case, there are 6 numbers (counting from 13 to 32). The median is the middle value of an ordered data set. Since the count of numbers is even, the median will be the average of the two middle values.\n\n3. **Step 3:** Now that we know there are 2 middle numbers, we can find their positions in the sorted list (positions start from 1). The middle positions would be 3 and 4 because the set starts from position 1.\n\n4. **Step 4:** Next, we extract these two values: `(18, 23)`. Since the count is even, the median will be the average of these values. To find the average, we sum the values and then divide by 2. So, (18 + 23)/2 = **20.5**.\n\n5. **\"Is there anything else I can help with?\"**\n\nNow, let's implement a Python function named `func99` to find the median of any given sorted list:\n\n```python\ndef func99(numbers):\n    n = len(numbers)\n    middle_positions = (n - 1) // 2 + 1, (n + 1) // 2\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        median = (numbers[middle_positions[0] - 1] + numbers[middle_positions[1] - 1]) / 2\n    else:\n        median = numbers[middle_positions[0] - 1]\n    return median\n```\n\nIn this function, we first determine the positions of the middle values if the count is even.
