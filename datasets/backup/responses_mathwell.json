A portion of them got a scoop of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry. We need to find out how many people got a scoop of ice cream that was not chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry.\n\nSECTION 2: Analyzing the Situation\n\nLet's break down the information we have:\n\n* 1/4 of the people got a scoop of chocolate.\n* 1/5 of the people got a scoop of vanilla.\n* 1/6 of the people got a scoop of strawberry.\n\nThis means that some people might have gotten multiple scoops, but for simplicity's sake, let's assume each person gets one scoop. We can find the number of people who got chocolate by multiplying 3000 by 1/4 (which is equal to 0.25). Similarly, we can find the number of people who got vanilla and strawberry.\n\nSECTION 3: Calculations\n\nLet's calculate the number of people who got each flavor:\n\n* Chocolate: 3000 x 0.25 = 750\n* Vanilla: 3000 x 0.20 (1/5 as a decimal) = 600\n* Strawberry: 3000 x 0.17 (1/6 as a decimal) = 510\n\nNow, let's add up the number of people who got each flavor:\n\n* Total people with chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry: 750 + 600 + 510 = 1860\n\nSECTION 4: Answer\n\nSince we're looking for people who didn't get chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry, we need to find out how many people are left. Let's subtract the total number of people with one of these flavors from the original 3000:\n\n* People who didn't get chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry: **3000 - 1860 = 1140**\n\n**So, 1140 people got a scoop of ice cream that was not chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry.**\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n```python\ndef func60():\n    total_people = 3000\n    total_chocolate = int(total_people * 0.25)\n    total_vanilla = int(total_people * 0.20)\n    total_strawberry = int(total_people * 0.17)\n\n    people_with_flavor = total_chocolate + total_vanilla + total_strawberry\n\n    people_without_flavor = total_people - people_with_flavor\n    return people_without_flavor\n\nprint(func60())  # Output: 1140\n```\nThe highlighted answer is **1140**.",

        "response": "<<Pikachu's Thunderbolt Count>>\n\nPikachu had a stash of 100 thunderbolts, ready to strike at any moment. But then he got into a battle with Squirtle and used up 20 of those precious bolts. That left him with 80 thunderbolts remaining. He didn't take long to get into another scrap, this time with Bulbasaur, and he needed all his might to take down that pesky plant-like Pok\u00e9mon. In the heat of battle, Pikachu unleashed 30 more thunderbolts, leaving him with a slightly smaller but still impressive cache of 50 thunderbolts.\n\nPikachu's not one to complain about using up some of his arsenal in the name of victory, and he knows he can always recharge or find more if needed. For now, though, he's content to have a respectable amount of thunderbolts at his disposal, just in case another battle breaks out. After all, you never know when you might need to strike quickly and decisively!",

Then, she adds another 200 punches, making a total of:\n\n500 + 200 = 700\n\nSo, Captain Marvel has punched a total of **700** times.\n\nHere's the Python function to calculate this:\n```\ndef func41():\n    return (100 * 5) + 200\nprint(func41())  # Output: 700\n```\n\nAnd here's the mathematical equation that solves this problem:\n\n$$\\text{Total punches} = (\\text{punches per minute}) \\times (\\text{minutes}) + \\text{additional punches}$$\n\nIn this case, we have:\n$$700 = (100) \\times (5) + 200$$\"",

How many enemies does he stomp on total?\n\n**Section 2: Understanding the Problem**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to add up the number of each type of enemy that Mario can stomp on. This will give us the total number of enemies.\n\n**Section 3: Solution**\n\nWe can create a Python function named func57 to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef func57():\n    goombas = 30\n    koopas = 20\n    piranha_plants = 10\n    \n    total_enemies = goombas + koopas + piranha_plants\n    \n    return total_enemies\n\nprint(func57())\n```\n\nWhen we run this function, it will calculate the total number of enemies Mario can stomp on and print the result.\n\n**Section 4: Keyword Integration**\n\nHere's an example of how we can integrate keywords ['guarantee', 'paper'] into our response:\n\nIn order to guarantee accurate results, we need to carefully consider all possible scenarios.
